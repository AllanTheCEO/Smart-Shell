<h1>But Wait... There's More!</h1>

<p>This collection is a supplement to my book, <em><a href="tlcl.php.html">The Linux
Command Line </a></em> (TLCL), so if you don't already have a copy, please
download one or, if you prefer, pick up a printed copy from your favorite
bookseller or library. We are going to build on our experience with the command
line and add some more tools and techniques to our repertoire.  Like TLCL, this
collection is not about Linux system administration; rather it is a collection
of topics I consider both fun and interesting. It covers many tools that will
be of interest to budding system administrators, but the topics were chosen for
other reasons.  Some were chosen because they are &quot;classic&quot; Unix,
others because they are just &quot;something you should know,&quot; but mostly
they were chosen because I find them fun and interesting.</p>

<p>The adventures are also <a href="tlcl.php.html#AWTLCL">available in book form.</a></p>

<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_mc.php.html">Midnight Commander</a></h3>
       
        <p>We will look at Midnight Commander, a character-based directory
        browser and file manager that bridges the two worlds of the familiar
        graphical file manager and the common command line tools such as
        <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>rm</code>.</p>

    </li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_termmux.php.html">Terminal Multiplexers</a></h3>

        <p>What if we could run multiple terminal sessions inside a single
        terminal window? Or how about if we could detach a running session and
        return to it later, on a different machine? Sound impossible? It's not.
        
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_lesstype.php.html">Less Typing</a></h3>

        <p>Fingers getting tired? Wrists starting to ache? Time to learn how do
        more with less typing.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_redirection.php.html">More Redirection</a></h3>
	
        <p>We'll look at I/O redirection again in a little more depth and learn a
        few tricks along the way.</p>

    </li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_tput.php.html">tput</a></h3>

        <p>While our command line environment is certainly powerful, it can be
        lacking when it comes to visual appeal. It doesn't have to be that way.
        Learn to take control of terminal output and add some visual spice.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_dialog.php.html">dialog</a></h3>

        <p>We're going to look at <code>dialog</code>, a program that displays
        various kinds of <em>dialog boxes</em> that we can incorporate into our
        shell scripts to give them a much friendlier face.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_awk.php.html">AWK</a></h3>

        <p>One of the great things we can do in the shell is embed other
        programming languages within the body of our scripts. In this
        adventure, we are going to look at one such program, <code>awk</code>,
        a classic pattern matching and text processing language.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_othershells.php.html">Other Shells</a></h3>

        <p>While we have spent a great deal of time learning the bash shell,
        it's not the only game in town. Unix has had several popular shells and
        almost all are available for Linux, too.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_powerterm.php.html">Power Terminals</a></h3>

        <p>In this adventure, we are going to look at a few of the different
        terminal programs and the many interesting things we can do with
        them.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_vimvigor.php.html">Vim, with Vigor</a></h3>

        <p>Vim is a very powerful program. In fact, it's safe to say that vim
        can do anything. It's just a question of figuring out how. In this
        adventure, we will acquire an intermediate level of skill in this
        popular tool.</p>

	</li>
    <li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_source.php.html">source</a></h3>

        <p>We looked at <code>source</code> briefly when we worked with the
        <code>.profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code> files used to establish
        the shell environment.</p> <p>In this adventure, we will look at
        <code>source</code> again and discover the ways it can make our scripts
        more powerful and easier to maintain.</p>
    
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><a href="lc3_adv_standards.php.html">Coding Standards Part 1</a></h3>

        <p>Most programming organizations have formal standards for coding
        practice and style. We will look at some and create one of our own.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_new_script.php.html">Coding Standards Part 2</a></h3>

        <p>There's one problem with having a coding standard. Once you have it,
        you have to follow it. In this adventure we will learn about
        <code>new_script</code>, a shell script template generator that
        performs much of the tedious mechanical work.</p>
        
    </li>
    <li>
		<h3><a href="lc3_adv_sql.php.html">SQL</a></h3>

        <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is the <i>lingua franca</i> of the
        database world. It's also a useful and important skill. In this
        adventure, we will look at its major features and techniques, as well
        as discover a command-line tool that makes SQL easy to use with our
        scripts and projects.</p>

    </li>
</ul>
