<h1>Errors and Signals and Traps (Oh My!) - Part 1</h1>

<p>In this lesson, we're going to look at handling errors during script execution.</p>

<p>The difference between a poor program and a good one is often measured in
terms of the program's <i>robustness</i>.  That is, the program's ability to
handle situations in which something goes wrong. </p>

<h2>Exit Status</h2>

<p>As we recall from previous lessons, every well-written program returns
an exit status when it finishes.  If a program finishes successfully, the
exit status will be zero.  If the exit status is anything other than zero,
then the program failed in some way.</p>

<p>It is very important to check the exit status of programs we call in our
scripts.  It is also important that our scripts return a meaningful exit status
when they finish.  There was once a Unix system administrator who wrote a
script for a production system containing the following 2 lines of code:</p>

<div class="codeexample"># Example of a really bad idea

cd "$some_directory"
rm *</div>

<p>Why is this such a bad way of doing it?  It's not, if nothing goes wrong.
The two lines change the working directory to the name contained in
<code>$some_directory</code> and delete the files in that directory.  That's
the intended behavior.  But what happens if the directory named in
<code>$some_directory</code> doesn't exist?  In that case, the <code>cd</code>
command will fail and the script executes the <code>rm</code> command on the
current working directory.  Not the intended behavior!</p>

<p>By the way, the hapless system administrator's script suffered this very
failure and it destroyed a large portion of an important production system.
Don't let this happen to you!</p>

<p>The problem with the script was that it did not check the exit status of the
<code>cd</code> command before proceeding with the <code>rm</code> command.</p>

<h2>Checking the Exit Status</h2>

<p>There are several ways we can get and respond to the exit status of a
program.  First, we can examine the contents of the <code>$?</code>
environment variable.  <code>$?</code> will contain the exit status of the
last command executed.  We can see this work with the following:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox]$ <code class="cmd"> true; echo $?</code>
0
[me@linuxbox]$ <code class="cmd">false; echo $?</code>
1</div>

<p>The <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> commands are programs that do
nothing except return an exit status of zero and one, respectively.  Using
them, we can see how the <code>$?</code> environment variable contains the exit
status of the previous program.</p>

<p>So to check the exit status, we could write the script this way:</p>

<div class="codeexample"># Check the exit status

<code class="user">cd</code> "$some_directory"
<code class="user">if [</code> "$?" = "0" <code class="user">]; then</code>
  rm *
<code class="user">else
  echo</code> "Cannot change directory!" 1&gt;&2
  <code class="user">exit</code> 1
<code class="user">fi</code></div>

<p>In this version, we examine the exit status of the <code>cd</code> command
and if it's not zero, we print an error message on standard error and
terminate the script with an exit status of 1.</p>

<p>While this is a working solution to the problem, there are more clever
methods that will save us some typing.  The next approach we can try is to
use the <code>if</code> statement directly, since it evaluates the exit status
of commands it is given.</p>

<p>Using <code>if</code>, we could write it this way:</p>

<div class="codeexample"># A better way

<code class="user">if cd</code> "$some_directory"; <code class="user">then</code>
  rm ./*
<code class="user">else
  echo</code> "Could not change directory! Aborting." 1&gt;&2
  <code class="user">exit</code> 1
<code class="user">fi</code></div>

<p>Here we check to see if the <code>cd</code> command is successful.  Only
then does <code>rm</code> get executed; otherwise an error message is output
and the program exits with a code of 1, indicating that an error has
occurred.</p>

<p>Notice too how we changed the target of the <code class="user">rm</code>
command from "*" to "./*". This is a safety precaution. The reason is a little
subtle and has to do with the lax way Unix-like systems name files. Since it is
possible to include almost any character in a file name, we must card against
file names that begin with hyphens as thy might be interpreted as command
options after the wildcard is expanded. For example, if there was a file named
<code>-rf</code> in the directory, it might cause <code class="user">rm</code>
to do unpleasant things. It's a good idea to always include "./" ahead of
leading asterisks in scripts.</p>

<h2>An Error Exit Function</h2>

<p>Since we will be checking for errors often in our programs, it makes sense
to write a function that will display error messages.  This will save more
typing and promote laziness.</p>

<div class="codeexample"># An error exit function

error_exit()
{
  <code class="user">echo</code> "$1" 1&gt;&2
  <code class="user">exit</code> 1
}

# Using error_exit

<code class="user">if cd</code> "$some_directory"; <code class="user">then</code>
  rm ./*
<code class="user">else</code>
  error_exit "Cannot change directory! Aborting."
<code class="user">fi</code></div>

<h2>AND and OR Lists</h2>

<p>Finally, we can further simplify our script by using the AND and OR
control operators.  To explain how they work, here is a quote from the <code
class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/bash1.html">bash</a></code> man page:</p>

<p>"The  control operators && and || denote AND lists and OR lists,
respectively.  An AND list has the form</p>

<div class="codeexample">command1 && command2</div>

<p><code>command2</code> is executed <i>if, and only if</i>, <code>command1</code>
returns an exit status of zero.</p>

<p>An OR list has the form</p>

<div class="codeexample">command1 || command2</div>

<p><code>command2</code> is executed <i>if, and only if</i>, <code>command1</code>
returns a non-zero exit status.   The  exit status of AND and OR lists
is the exit status of the last command executed in the list."</p>

<p>Again, we can use the <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> commands to see
this work:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox]$ <code class="cmd">true || echo "echo executed"</code>
[me@linuxbox]$ <code class="cmd">false || echo "echo executed"</code>
echo executed
[me@linuxbox]$ <code class="cmd">true && echo "echo executed"</code>
echo executed
[me@linuxbox]$ <code class="cmd">false && echo "echo executed"</code>
[me@linuxbox]$</div>

<p>Using this technique, we can write an even simpler version:</p>

<div class="codeexample"># Simplest of all

<code class="user">cd</code> "$some_directory" || error_exit "Cannot change directory! Aborting"
rm *</div>

<p>If an exit is not required in case of error, then we can even do this:</p>

<div class="codeexample"># Another way to do it if exiting is not desired

<code class="user">cd</code> "$some_directory" && rm ./*</div>

<p>We need to point out that even with the defense against errors we have
introduced in our example for the use of <code>cd</code>, this code is still
vulnerable to a common programming error, namely, what happens if the name of
the variable containing the name of the directory is misspelled?  In that case,
the shell will interpret the variable as empty and the <code>cd</code> succeed,
but it will change directories to the user's home directory, so beware!</p>

<h2>Improving the Error Exit Function</h2>

<p>There are a number of improvements that we can make to the
<code>error_exit</code> function.  It is useful to include the name of the
program in the error message to make clear where the error is coming from.
This becomes more important as our programs get more complex and we start
having scripts launching other scripts, etc.  Also, note the inclusion of the
<code>LINENO</code> environment variable which will help identify the exact
line within a script where the error occurred.</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# A slicker error handling routine

# I put a variable in my scripts named PROGNAME which
# holds the name of the program being run.  You can get this
# value from the first item on the command line ($0).

PROGNAME="$(basename $0)"

error_exit()
{

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Function for exit due to fatal program error
#   Accepts 1 argument:
#     string containing descriptive error message
# ----------------------------------------------------------------


  <code class="user">echo</code> "${PROGNAME}: ${1:-"Unknown Error"}" 1&gt;&2
  <code class="user">exit</code> 1
}

# Example call of the error_exit function.  Note the inclusion
# of the LINENO environment variable.  It contains the current
# line number.

<code class="user">echo</code> "Example of error with line number and message"
error_exit "$LINENO: An error has occurred."</div>

<p>The use of the curly braces within the <code>error_exit</code> function is
an example of <i>parameter expansion</i>.  We can surround a variable name with
curly braces (as with <code>${PROGNAME}</code>) if we need to be sure it is
separated from surrounding text.  Some people just put them around every
variable out of habit.  That usage is simply a style thing.  The second use,
<code>${1:-"Unknown Error"}</code> means that if parameter 1 (<code>$1</code>)
is undefined, substitute the string "Unknown Error" in its place.  Using
parameter expansion, it is possible to perform a number of useful string
manipulations.  More information about parameter expansion can be found in the
<code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/bash1.html">bash</a></code> man page
under the topic "EXPANSIONS".</p>
