STDBUF(1)                     User Commands                     STDBUF(1)

NAME
       stdbuf  -  Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its
       standard streams.

SYNOPSIS
       stdbuf OPTION... COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for  its  standard
       streams.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for short
       options too.

       -i, --input=MODE
              adjust standard input stream buffering

       -o, --output=MODE
              adjust standard output stream buffering

       -e, --error=MODE
              adjust standard error stream buffering

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If MODE is 'L' the corresponding stream  will  be  line  buffered.
       This option is invalid with standard input.

       If MODE is '0' the corresponding stream will be unbuffered.

       Otherwise  MODE  is  a  number which may be followed by one of the
       following: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and  so  on
       for  G,  T,  P, E, Z, Y.  Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K,
       MiB=M, and so on.  In this case the corresponding stream  will  be
       fully buffered with the buffer size set to MODE bytes.

       NOTE:  If  COMMAND  adjusts  the buffering of its standard streams
       ('tee' does for example) then  that  will  override  corresponding
       changes by 'stdbuf'.  Also some filters (like 'dd' and 'cat' etc.)
       don't use streams for I/O, and are  thus  unaffected  by  'stdbuf'
       settings.

EXAMPLES
       tail -f access.log | stdbuf -oL cut -d ' ' -f1 | uniq
       This will immediately display unique entries from access.log

BUGS
       On  GLIBC  platforms,  specifying a buffer size, i.e., using fully
       buffered mode will result in undefined operation.
