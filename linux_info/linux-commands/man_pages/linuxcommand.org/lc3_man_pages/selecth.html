NAME
    select - Select words from a list and execute commands.

SYNOPSIS
    select NAME [in WORDS ... ;] do COMMANDS; done

DESCRIPTION
    Select words from a list and execute commands.
    
    The WORDS are expanded, generating a list of words.  The
    set of expanded words is printed on the standard error, each
    preceded by a number.  If `in WORDS' is not present, `in "$@"'
    is assumed.  The PS3 prompt is then displayed and a line read
    from the standard input.  If the line consists of the number
    corresponding to one of the displayed words, then NAME is set
    to that word.  If the line is empty, WORDS and the prompt are
    redisplayed.  If EOF is read, the command completes.  Any other
    value read causes NAME to be set to null.  The line read is saved
    in the variable REPLY.  COMMANDS are executed after each selection
    until a break command is executed.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns the status of the last command executed.
