ZLESS(1)                 General Commands Manual                 ZLESS(1)

NAME
       zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text

SYNOPSIS
       zless [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zless  is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain
       text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is
       the  equivalent  of  setting  the environment variable LESSOPEN to
       '|gzip -cdfq -- %s', and the environment variable LESSMETACHARS to
       '&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;;*?"()&lt;&gt;[|&^`#\$%=~', and then running less.
       However, enough people seem to think that having the command zless
       available is important to be worth providing it.

SEE ALSO
       zmore(1), less(1)

BUGS
       Zless  does  not work with compressed data that is piped to it via
       standard input; it requires that input files be specified as argu‐
       ments.   To read compressed data from a pipe, you can use ...|gun‐
       zip|less instead of ...|zless.
