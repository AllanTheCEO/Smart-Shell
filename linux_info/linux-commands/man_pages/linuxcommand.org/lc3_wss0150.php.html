<h1>Errors and Signals and Traps (Oh, My!) - Part 2</h1>

<p>Errors are not the only way that a script can terminate unexpectedly.  We
also have to be concerned with signals.  Consider the following program:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

<code class="user">echo</code> "this script will endlessly loop until you stop it"
<code class="user">while</code> true; <code class="user">do</code>
  <code class="user">:</code> # Do nothing
<code class="user">done</code></div>

<p>After we launch this script it will appear to hang.  Actually, like most
programs that appear to hang, it is really stuck inside a loop.  In this case,
it is waiting for the <code>true</code> command to return a non-zero exit
status, which it never does.  Once started, the script will continue until bash
receives a signal that will stop it.  We can send such a signal by typing
Ctrl-c, the signal called SIGINT (short for SIGnal INTerrupt).

<h2>Cleaning Up After Ourselves</h2>
 
<p>Okay, so a signal can come along and make our script terminate.  Why does it matter? 
Well, in many cases it doesn't matter and we can safely ignore signals, but in some
cases it will matter.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at another script:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# Program to print a text file with headers and footers

TEMP_FILE=/tmp/printfile.txt

pr $1 &gt; "$TEMP_FILE"

<code class="user">read</code> -p "Print file? [y/n]: "
<code class="user">if [</code> "$REPLY" = "y" <code class="user">]; then</code>
  lpr "$TEMP_FILE"
<code class="user">fi</code></div>

<p>This script processes the text file specified on the command line with the
<code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/pr1.html">pr</a></code> command and
stores the result in a temporary file.  Next, it asks the user if they want to
print the file.  If the user types "y", then the temporary file is passed to
the <code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/lpr1.html">lpr</a></code> program for
printing (substitute <code>less</code> for <code>lpr</code> if there isn't a
printer attached to the system.)</p>

<p>Admittedly, this script has a lot of design problems.  While it needs a
file name passed on the command line, it doesn't check that it received one,
and it doesn't check that the file actually exists. But the problem we want to
focus on here is  that when the script terminates, it leaves behind the
temporary file.</p>

<p>Good practice dictates that we delete the temporary file
<code>$TEMP_FILE</code> when the script terminates.  This is easily
accomplished by adding the following to the end of the script:</p>

<div class="codeexample">rm "$TEMP_FILE"</div>

<p>This would seem to solve the problem, but what happens if the user types
ctrl-c when the "Print file? [y/n]:" prompt appears?  The script will terminate
at the <code class="user">read</code> command and the <code
class="user">rm</code> command is never executed.  Clearly, we need a way to
respond to signals such as SIGINT when the <code>Ctrl-c</code> key is typed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, bash provides a method to perform commands if and when signals
are received.</p>

<h2>trap</h2>

<p>The <code class="user">trap</code> command allows us to execute a command when our script
receives a signal. It works like this:</p>

<div class="codeexample"><code class="user">trap</code> arg signals</div>

<p>"signals" is a list of signals to intercept and "arg" is a command to execute
when one of the signals is received.  For our printing script, we might handle
the signal problem this way:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# Program to print a text file with headers and footers

TEMP_FILE=/tmp/printfile.txt

<code class="user">trap</code> "rm $TEMP_FILE; exit" SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM

pr $1 &gt; "$TEMP_FILE"

<code class="user">read</code> -p "Print file? [y/n]: "
<code class="user">if [</code> "$REPLY" = "y" <code class="user">]; then</code>
  lpr "$TEMP_FILE"
<code class="user">fi</code>
rm "$TEMP_FILE"</div>

<p>Here we have added a <code class="user">trap</code> command that will execute "<code>rm
$TEMP_FILE</code>" if any of the listed signals is received.  The three signals
listed are the most common ones that most scripts are likely to encounter, but
there are many more that can be specified.  For a complete list, type
"<code>trap -l</code>".  In addition to listing the signals by name, you may
alternately specify them by number.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Signal 9 from Outer Space</h2>

<p>There is one signal that you cannot trap: SIGKILL or signal 9.  The kernel
immediately terminates any process sent this signal and no signal handling is
performed.  Since it will always terminate a program that is stuck, hung, or
otherwise screwed up, it is tempting to think that it's the easy way out when
we have to get something to stop and go away.  There are often references to
the following command which sends the SIGKILL signal:</p>

<code>kill -9</code>

<p>However, despite its apparent ease, we must remember that when we send this
signal, no processing is done by the application.  Often this is OK, but with
many programs it's not.  In particular, many complex programs (and some
not-so-complex) create <i>lock files</i> to prevent multiple copies of the
program from running at the same time.  When a program that uses a lock file is
sent a SIGKILL, it doesn't get the chance to remove the lock file when it
terminates.  The presence of the lock file will prevent the program from
restarting until the lock file is manually removed.</p>

<p>Be warned.  Use SIGKILL as a last resort.</p>
</div>

<h2>A clean_up Function</h2>

<p>While the <code class="user">trap</code> command has solved the problem, we
can see that it has some limitations.  Most importantly, it will only accept a
single string containing the command to be performed when the signal is
received.  We could get clever and use ";" and put multiple commands in the
string to get more complex behavior, but frankly, it's ugly.  A better way
would be to create a function that is called when we want to perform any
actions at the end of a script.  For our purposes, we will call this function
<code>clean_up</code>.</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# Program to print a text file with headers and footers

TEMP_FILE=/tmp/printfile.txt

clean_up() {

  # Perform program exit housekeeping
  rm "$TEMP_FILE"
  <code class="user">exit</code>
}

<code class="user">trap</code> clean_up SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM

pr $1 &gt; "$TEMP_FILE"

<code class="user">read</code> -p "Print file? [y/n]: "
<code class="user">if [</code> "$REPLY" = "y" <code class="user">]; then</code>
  lpr "$TEMP_FILE"
<code class="user">fi</code>
clean_up</div>

<p>The use of a clean up function is a good idea for our error handling
routines too.  After all, when a program terminates (for whatever reason), we
should clean up after ourselves.  Here is finished version of our program with
improved error and signal handling:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# Program to print a text file with headers and footers

# Usage: printfile file

PROGNAME="$(basename $0)"

# Create a temporary file name that gives preference
# to the user's local tmp directory and has a name
# that is resistant to tmp race attacks

<code class="user">if [</code> -d "~/tmp" <code class="user">]; then</code>
  TEMP_DIR=~/tmp
<code class="user">else</code>
  TEMP_DIR=/tmp
<code class="user">fi</code>
TEMP_FILE="$TEMP_DIR/$PROGNAME.$$.$RANDOM"

usage() {

  # Display usage message on standard error
  <code class="user">echo</code> "Usage: $PROGNAME file" 1&gt;&2
}

clean_up() {

  # Perform program exit housekeeping
  # Optionally accepts an exit status
  rm -f "$TEMP_FILE"
  <code class="user">exit</code> $1
}

error_exit() {

  # Display error message and exit
  <code class="user">echo</code> "${PROGNAME}: ${1:-"Unknown Error"}" 1&gt;&2
  clean_up 1
}

<code class="user">trap</code> clean_up SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM

<code class="user">if [</code> $# != "1" <code class="user">]; then</code>
  usage
  error_exit "one file to print must be specified"
<code class="user">fi</code>
<code class="user">if [</code> ! -f "$1" <code class="user">]; then</code>
  error_exit "file $1 cannot be read"
<code class="user">fi</code>

pr $1 &gt; "$TEMP_FILE" || error_exit "cannot format file"

<code class="user">read</code> -p "Print file? [y/n]: "
<code class="user">if [</code> "$REPLY" = "y" <code class="user">]; then</code>
  lpr "$TEMP_FILE" || error_exit "cannot print file"
<code class="user">fi</code>
clean_up</div>

<h2>Creating Safe Temporary Files</h2>

<p>In the program above, there a number of steps taken to help secure the
temporary file used by this script.  It is a Unix tradition to use a directory
called <code>/tmp</code> to place temporary files used by programs.  Everyone
may write files into this directory.  This naturally leads to some security
concerns.  If possible, avoid writing files in the <code>/tmp</code> directory.
The preferred technique is to write them in a local directory such as
<code>~/tmp</code> (a tmp subdirectory in the user's home directory.)  If files
must be written in <code>/tmp</code>, we must take steps to make sure the file
names are not predictable.  Predictable file names may allow an attacker to
create symbolic links to other files the attacker wants the user to
overwrite.</p>

<p>A good file name will help identify what wrote the file, but will not be
entirely predictable.  In the script above, the following line of code created
the temporary file <code>$TEMP_FILE</code>:</p>

<div class="codeexample">TEMP_FILE="$TEMP_DIR/$PROGNAME.$$.$RANDOM"</div>

<p>The <code>$TEMP_DIR</code> variable contains either <code>/tmp</code> or
<code>~/tmp</code> depending on the availability of the directory.  It is
common practice to embed the name of the program into the file name. We have
done that with the constant <code>$PROGNAME</code> constructed at the beginning
of the sectipt.  Next, we use the <code>$$</code> shell variable to embed the
process id (pid) of the program.  This further helps identify what process is
responsible for the file.  Surprisingly, the process id alone is not
unpredictable enough to make the file safe, so we add the <code>$RANDOM</code>
shell variable to append a random number to the file name.  With this
technique, we create a file name that is both easily identifiable and
unpredictable.</p>
