type <i>command</i></pre>

<p>where “command” is the name of the command we want to examine. Here are some
examples:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">type type</code>
type is a shell builtin
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">type ls</code>
s is aliased to `ls --color=auto'
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">type cp</code>
cp is /bin/cp</div>

<p>Here we see the results for three different commands. Notice that the one
for <code class="user">ls</code> and how the ls command is actually an alias
for the <code class="user">ls</code> command with the “-- color=auto” option
added. Now we know why the output from <code class="user">ls</code> is
displayed in color!</p>

<h3>which</h3>

<p>Sometimes there is more than one version of an executable program installed
on a system. While this is not very common on desktop systems, it's not unusual
on large servers. To determine the exact location of a given executable, the
<code class="user">which</code> command is used:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">which ls</code>
/bin/ls</div>

<p><code class="user">which</code> only works for executable programs, not
builtins nor aliases that are substitutes for actual executable programs.</p>

<h2>Getting Command Documentation</h2>

<p>With this knowledge of what a command is, we can now search for the
documentation available for each kind of command.</p>

<h3>help</h3>

<p><code class="user">bash</code> has a built-in help facility available for
each of the shell builtins. To use it, type “help” followed by the name of the
shell builtin.  Optionally, we can add the -m option to change the format of
the output. For example:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">help -m cd</code>
NAME
    cd - Change the shell working directory.

SYNOPSIS
    cd [-L|-P] [dir]

DESCRIPTION
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.
    
    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
    
    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.
    
    Options:
        -L  force symbolic links to be followed
        -P  use the physical directory structure without following symbolic
      links
    
    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed; non-zero otherwise.

<p><b>A note on notation:</b> When square brackets appear in the description of a command's
syntax, they indicate optional items. A vertical bar character indicates mutually exclusive
items. In the case of the <code class="user">cd</code> command above:</p>

<pre>cd [-L|-P] [dir]</pre>
<pre>man <i>program</i></pre>

<p>where “program” is the name of the command to view.  Man pages vary somewhat
in format but generally contain a title, a synopsis of the command's syntax, a
description of the command's purpose, and a listing and description of each of
the command's options. Man pages, however, do not usually include examples, and
are intended as a reference, not a tutorial. Let's try viewing the man page for
the <code class="user">ls</code> command: </p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">man ls</code></div>

<p>On most Linux systems, <code class="user">man</code> uses <code
class="user">less</code> to display the manual page, so all of the familiar
<code class="user">less</code> commands work while displaying the page.</p>

<h3>README and Other Documentation Files</h3>

<p>Many software packages installed on your system have documentation files
residing in the <code>/usr/share/doc</code> directory.  Most of these are
stored in plain text format and can be viewed with <code
class="user">less</code>. Some of the files are in HTML format and can be
viewed with a web browser. We may encounter some files ending with a “.gz”
extension. This indicates that they have been compressed with the <code
class="user">gzip</code> compression program. The gzip package includes a
special version of <code class="user">less</code> called <code
class="user">zless</code> that will display the contents of gzip-compressed
text files.</p>
