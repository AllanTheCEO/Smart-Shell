  
NAME
    pushd - Add directories to stack.

SYNOPSIS
    pushd [-n] [+N | -N | dir]

DESCRIPTION
    Add directories to stack.
    
    Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates
    the stack, making the new top of the stack the current working
    directory.  With no arguments, exchanges the top two directories.
    
    Options:
      -n	Suppresses the normal change of directory when adding
    		directories to the stack, so only the stack is manipulated.
    
    Arguments:
      +N	Rotates the stack so that the Nth directory (counting
    		from the left of the list shown by `dirs', starting with
    		zero) is at the top.
    
      -N	Rotates the stack so that the Nth directory (counting
    		from the right of the list shown by `dirs', starting with
    		zero) is at the top.
    
      dir	Adds DIR to the directory stack at the top, making it the
    		new current working directory.
    
    The `dirs' builtin displays the directory stack.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid argument is supplied or the directory
    change fails.
