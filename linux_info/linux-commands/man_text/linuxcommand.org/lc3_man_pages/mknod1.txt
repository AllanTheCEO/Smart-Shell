NAME
       mknod - make block or character special files

SYNOPSIS
       mknod [OPTION]... NAME TYPE [MAJOR MINOR]

DESCRIPTION
       Create the special file NAME of the given TYPE.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for short
       options too.

       -m, --mode=MODE
              set file permission bits to MODE, not a=rw - umask

       -Z     set the SELinux security context to default type

       --context[=CTX]
              like -Z, or if CTX is specified then  set  the  SELinux  or
              SMACK security context to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Both  MAJOR  and  MINOR must be specified when TYPE is b, c, or u,
       and they must be omitted when TYPE is p.  If MAJOR or MINOR begins
       with  0x or 0X, it is interpreted as hexadecimal; otherwise, if it
       begins with 0, as octal; otherwise, as decimal.  TYPE may be:

       b      create a block (buffered) special file

       c, u   create a character (unbuffered) special file

       p      create a FIFO

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of mknod, which  usually
       supersedes  the  version  described  here.   Please  refer to your
       shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
