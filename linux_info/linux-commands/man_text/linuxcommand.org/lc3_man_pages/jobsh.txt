    		notification
      -p	lists process IDs only
      -r	restrict output to running jobs
      -s	restrict output to stopped jobs
    
    If -x is supplied, COMMAND is run after all job specifications that
    appear in ARGS have been replaced with the process ID of that job's
    process group leader.
    
    Exit Status:
