  
NAME
    complete - Specify how arguments are to be completed by Readline.

SYNOPSIS
    complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-pr] [-DEI] [-o option] [-A action] [-G globpat] [-W wordlist]  [-F function] [-C command] [-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] [name ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Specify how arguments are to be completed by Readline.
    
    For each NAME, specify how arguments are to be completed.  If no options
    are supplied, existing completion specifications are printed in a way that
    allows them to be reused as input.
    
    Options:
      -p	print existing completion specifications in a reusable format
      -r	remove a completion specification for each NAME, or, if no
    		NAMEs are supplied, all completion specifications
      -D	apply the completions and actions as the default for commands
    		without any specific completion defined
      -E	apply the completions and actions to "empty" commands --
    		completion attempted on a blank line
      -I	apply the completions and actions to the initial (usually the
    		command) word
    
    When completion is attempted, the actions are applied in the order the
    uppercase-letter options are listed above.  If multiple options are supplied,
    the -D option takes precedence over -E, and both take precedence over -I.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or an error occurs.
