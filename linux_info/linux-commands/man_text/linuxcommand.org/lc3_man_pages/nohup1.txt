NAME
       nohup - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty

SYNOPSIS
       nohup COMMAND [ARG]...
       nohup OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  standard  input  is a terminal, redirect it from an unreadable
       file.   If  standard  output  is  a  terminal,  append  output  to
       'nohup.out' if possible, '$HOME/nohup.out' otherwise.  If standard
       error is a terminal, redirect it to standard output.  To save out‐
       put to FILE, use 'nohup COMMAND &gt; FILE'.

       NOTE:  your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually
       supersedes the version  described  here.   Please  refer  to  your
       shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
