NAME
       runcon - run command with specified SELinux security context

SYNOPSIS
       runcon CONTEXT COMMAND [args]
       runcon  [  -c  ]  [-u USER] [-r ROLE] [-t TYPE] [-l RANGE] COMMAND
       [args]

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND with completely-specified CONTEXT, or with current  or
       transitioned  security  context  modified by one or more of LEVEL,
       ROLE, TYPE, and USER.

       If none of -c, -t, -u, -r, or -l, is specified, the first argument
       is  used  as the complete context.  Any additional arguments after
       COMMAND are interpreted as arguments to the command.

       Note that only carefully-chosen contexts are  likely  to  success‐
       fully run.

       Run  a program in a different SELinux security context.  With nei‐
       ther CONTEXT nor COMMAND, print the current security context.

       Mandatory arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for  short
       options too.

       CONTEXT
              Complete security context

       -c, --compute

       -t, --type=TYPE
