NAME
       base32 - base32 encode/decode data and print to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       base32 [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Base32  encode or decode FILE, or standard input, to standard out‐
       put.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for  short
       options too.

       -d, --decode
              decode data

       -i, --ignore-garbage
              when decoding, ignore non-alphabet characters

       -w, --wrap=COLS
              wrap  encoded lines after COLS character (default 76).  Use
              0 to disable line wrapping

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The data are encoded as described for the base32 alphabet  in  RFC
       4648.   When  decoding, the input may contain newlines in addition
       to the bytes of the formal base32 alphabet.  Use  --ignore-garbage
       to  attempt  to  recover  from any other non-alphabet bytes in the
       encoded stream.
