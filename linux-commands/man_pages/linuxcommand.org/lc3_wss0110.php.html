<h1>Flow Control - Part 2</h1>

<p>Hold on to your hats. This lesson is going to be a big one!</p>

<h2>More Branching</h2>

<p>In the <a href="lc3_wss0080.php.html">previous lesson on flow control</a> we
learned about the <code class= "user">if</code> command and how it is used to
alter program flow based on a command's exit status. In programming terms, this
type of program flow is called <i>branching</i> because it is like traversing a
tree. We come to a fork in the tree and the evaluation of a condition
determines which branch we take.</p>

<p>There is a second and more complex kind of branching called a <i>case</i>. A
case is multiple-choice branch. Unlike the simple branch, where we take one of
two possible paths, a case supports several possible outcomes based on the
evaluation of a value.</p>

<p>We can construct this type of branch with multiple <code
class="user">if</code> statements. In the example below, we evaluate some input
from the user:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

<code class="user">read</code> -p "Enter a number between 1 and 3 inclusive &gt; " character
<code class="user">if [</code> "$character" = "1" <code class="user">]; then</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "You entered one."
<code class="user">elif [</code> "$character" = "2" <code class="user">]; then</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "You entered two."
<code class="user">elif [</code> "$character" = "3" <code class="user">]; then</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "You entered three."
<code class="user">else
    echo</code> "You did not enter a number between 1 and 3."
<code class="user">fi</code></div>

<p>Not very pretty.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the shell provides a more elegant solution to this problem. It
provides a built-in command called <code class="user"><a
href="lc3_man_pages/caseh.html">case</a></code>, which can be used to construct
an equivalent program:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

<code class="user">read</code> -p "Enter a number between 1 and 3 inclusive &gt; " character
<code class="user">case</code> $character <code class="user">in</code>
    1 ) <code class="user">echo</code> "You entered one."
        ;;
    2 ) <code class="user">echo</code> "You entered two."
        ;;
    3 ) <code class="user">echo</code> "You entered three."
        ;;
    * ) <code class="user">echo</code> "You did not enter a number between 1 and 3."
<code class="user">esac</code></div>

<p>The <code class="user">case</code> command has the following form:</p>

<div class="codeexample"><code class="user">case</code> word <code class="user">in</code>
    patterns <code class="user">)</code> commands <code class="user">;;</code>
<code class="user">esac</code></div>

<p><code class="user">case</code> selectively executes statements if
<code>word</code> matches a pattern. We can have any number of patterns and
statements. Patterns can be literal text or wildcards. We can have multiple
patterns separated by the "<code>|</code>" character.  Here is a more advanced
example to show how this works:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

<code class="user">read</code> -p "Type a digit or a letter &gt; " character
<code class="user">case</code> $character <code class="user">in</code>
                                # Check for letters
    [[:lower:]] | [[:upper:]] ) <code class="user">echo</code> "You typed the letter $character"
                                ;;

                                # Check for digits
    [0-9] )                     <code class="user">echo</code> "You typed the digit $character"
                                ;;

                                # Check for anything else
    * )                         <code class="user">echo</code> "You did not type a letter or a digit"
<code class="user">esac</code></div>

<p>Notice the special pattern "<code>*</code>". This pattern will match
anything, so it is used to catch cases that did not match previous patterns.
Inclusion of this pattern at the end is wise, as it can be used to detect
invalid input.</p>

<h2>Loops</h2>

<p>The final type of program flow control we will discuss is called
<i>looping</i>. Looping is repeatedly executing a section of a program based on
the exit status of a command. The shell provides three commands for looping:
<code class="user">while</code>, <code class="user">until</code> and <code
class= "user">for</code>. We are going to cover <code class=
"user">while</code> and <code class="user">until</code> in this lesson and
<code class="user">for</code> in a upcoming lesson.</p>

<p>The <code class="user">while</code> command causes a block of code to be
executed over and over, as long as the exit status of a specified command is
true. Here is a simple example of a program that counts from zero to nine:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

number=0
<code class="user">while</code> <code class="user">[</code> "$number" -lt 10 <code class="user">]; do</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "Number = $number"
    number=$((number + 1))
<code class="user">done</code></div>

<p>On line 3, we create a variable called <code>number</code> and initialize
its value to 0.  Next, we start the <code class="user">while</code> loop. As we
can see, we have specified a command that tests the value of
<code>number</code>. In our example, we test to see if <code>number</code> has
a value less than 10.</p>

<p>Notice the word <code>do</code> on line 4 and the word <code>done</code> on
line 7. These enclose the block of code that will be repeated as long as the
exit status remains zero.</p>

<p>In most cases, the block of code that repeats must do something that will
eventually change the exit status, otherwise we will have what is called an
<i>endless loop</i>; that is, a loop that never ends.</p>

<p>In the example, the repeating block of code outputs the value of
<code>number</code> (the <code class="user">echo</code> command on line 5) and
increments <code>number</code> by one on line 6. Each time the block of code is
completed, the test command's exit status is evaluated again. After the tenth
iteration of the loop, <code>number</code> has been incremented ten times and
the <code class="user">test</code> command will terminate with a non-zero exit
status. At that point, the program flow resumes with the statement following
the word <code>done</code>. Since <code>done</code> is the last line of our
example, the program ends.</p>

<p>The <code class="user">until</code> command works exactly the same way,
except the block of code is repeated as long as the specified command's exit
status is false. In the example below, notice how the expression given to the
<code class="user">test</code> command has been changed from the <code
class="user">while</code> example to achieve the same result:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

number=0
<code class="user">until [</code> "$number" -ge 10 <code class="user">]; do</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "Number = $number"
    number=$((number + 1))
<code class="user">done</code></div>

<h2>Building a Menu</h2>

<p>A common user interface for text-based programs is a <i>menu</i>.  A menu is
a list of choices from which the user can pick.</p>

<p>In the example below, we use our new knowledge of loops and cases to build a
simple menu driven application:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

selection=
<code class="user">until [</code> "$selection" = "0" <code class="user">]; do</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "
    PROGRAM MENU
    1 - Display free disk space
    2 - Display free memory

    0 - exit program
"
    <code class="user">echo</code> -n "Enter selection: "
    <code class="user">read</code> selection
    <code class="user">echo</code> ""
    <code class="user">case</code> $selection <code class="user">in</code>
        1 ) df ;;
        2 ) free ;;
        0 ) <code class="user">exit</code> ;;
        * ) <code class="user">echo</code> "Please enter 1, 2, or 0"
    <code class="user">esac
done</code></div>

<p>The purpose of the <code class="user">until</code> loop in this program is
to re-display the menu each time a selection has been completed. The loop will
continue until selection is equal to 0, the "exit" choice. Notice how we defend
against entries from the user that are not valid choices.</p>

<p>To make this program better looking when it runs, we can enhance it by
adding a function that asks the user to press the Enter key after each
selection has been completed, and clears the screen before the menu is
displayed again. Here is the enhanced example:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

press_enter()
{
    <code class="user">echo</code> -en "\nPress Enter to continue"
    <code class="user">read</code>
    clear
}

selection=
<code class="user">until [</code> "$selection" = "0" <code class="user">]; do</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "
    PROGRAM MENU
    1 - display free disk space
    2 - display free memory

    0 - exit program
"
    <code class="user">echo</code> -n "Enter selection: "
    <code class="user">read</code> selection
    <code class="user">echo</code> ""
    <code class="user">case</code> $selection <code class="user">in</code>
        1 ) df <code class="user">;</code> press_enter ;;
        2 ) free <code class="user">;</code> press_enter ;;
        0 ) <code class="user">exit</code> ;;
        * ) <code class="user">echo</code> "Please enter 1, 2, or 0"; press_enter
    <code class="user">esac
done</code></div><br>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>When your computer hangs...</h2>

<p>We have all had the experience of an application <i>hanging</i>. Hanging is
when a program suddenly seems to stop and become unresponsive.  While you might
think that the program has stopped, in most cases, the program is still running
but its program logic is stuck in an endless loop.</p>

<p>Imagine this situation: you have an external device attached to your
computer, such as a USB disk drive but you forgot to turn it on. You try and
use the device but the application hangs instead. When this happens, you could
picture the following dialog going on between the application and the interface
for the device:</p>

<pre>
Application:    Are you ready?
Interface:  Device not ready.

Application:    Are you ready?
Interface:  Device not ready.

Application:    Are you ready?
Interface:  Device not ready.
</pre>

<p>and so on, forever.</p>

<p>Well-written software tries to avoid this situation by instituting a
<i>timeout</i>. This means that the loop is also counting the number of
attempts or calculating the amount of time it has waited for something to
happen. If the number of tries or the amount of time allowed is exceeded, the
loop exits and the program generates an error and exits.</p> </div>
