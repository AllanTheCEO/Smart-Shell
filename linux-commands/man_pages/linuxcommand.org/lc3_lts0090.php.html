<h1>Permissions</h1>

<p>The Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing
systems in that they are not only <i>multitasking</i> but also
<i>multi-user</i>.</p>

<p>What exactly does this mean? It means that more than one user can be
operating the computer at the same time. While a desktop or laptop computer
only has one keyboard and monitor, it can still be used by more than one user.
For example, if the computer is attached to a network, or the Internet, remote
users can log in via <code class="user"><a href=
"lc3_man_pages/ssh1.html">ssh</a></code> (secure shell) and operate the
computer. In fact, remote users can execute graphical applications and have the
output displayed on a remote computer. The X Window system supports this.</p>

<p>The multi-user capability of Unix-like systems is a feature that is deeply
ingrained into the design of the operating system. If we remember the
environment in which Unix was created, this makes perfect sense. Years ago
before computers were "personal," they were large, expensive, and centralized.
A typical university computer system consisted of a large mainframe computer
located in some building on campus and <i>terminals</i> were located throughout
the campus, each connected to the large central computer. The computer would
support many users at the same time.</p>

<p>In order to make this practical, a method had to be devised to protect the
users from each other.  After all, we wouldn't want the actions of one user to
crash the computer, nor would we allow one user to interfere with the files
belonging to another user.</p>

<p>This lesson will cover the following commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/chmod1.html">chmod</a></code> - modify
  file access rights</li>

  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/su1.html">su</a></code> - temporarily
  become the superuser</li>

  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/sudo8.html">sudo</a></code> - temporarily
  become the superuser</li>
  
  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/chown1.html">chown</a></code> - change
  file ownership</li>

  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/chgrp1.html">chgrp</a></code> - change a
  file's group ownership</li>
</ul>

<h2>File Permissions</h2>

<p>On a Linux system, each file and directory is assigned access rights for the
owner of the file, the members of a group of related users, and everybody else.
Rights can be assigned to read a file, to write a file, and to execute a file
(i.e., run the file as a program).</p>

<p>To see the permission settings for a file, we can use the <code
class="user">ls</code> command.  As an example, we will look at the <code
class="user">bash</code> program which is located in the <code>/bin</code>
directory:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls -l /bin/bash</code>
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1113504 Jun  6  2019 /bin/bash</div>

<p>Here we can see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The file "/bin/bash" is owned by user
  "root"</li>

  <li>The superuser has the right to read, write,
  and execute this file</li>

  <li>The file is owned by the group "root"</li>

  <li>Members of the group "root" can also read and
  execute this file</li>

  <li>Everybody else can read and execute this
  file</li>
</ul>

<p>In the diagram below, we see how the first portion of the listing is
interpreted. It consists of a character indicating the file type, followed by
three sets of three characters that convey the reading, writing and execution
permission for the owner, group, and everybody else.<br><br>

<h2>chmod</h2>

<p>The <code class="user">chmod</code> command is used to change the
permissions of a file or directory.  To use it, we specify the desired
permission settings and the file or files that we wish to modify. There are two
ways to specify the permissions. In this lesson we will focus on one of these,
called the <i>octal notation</i> method.</p>

<p>It is easy to think of the permission settings as a series of bits (which is
how the computer thinks about them). Here's how it works:</p>

<pre>rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111
rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110
rwx --- --- = 111 000 000

and so on...

rwx = 111 in binary = 7
rw- = 110 in binary = 6
r-x = 101 in binary = 5
r-- = 100 in binary = 4</pre>

<p>Now, if we represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group,
and other) as a single digit, we have a pretty convenient way of expressing the
possible permissions settings. For example, if we wanted to set
<code>some_file</code> to have read and write permission for the owner, but
wanted to keep the file private from others, we would:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">chmod 600 some_file</code></div>

<p>Here is a table of numbers that covers all the common settings. The ones
beginning with "7" are used with programs (since they enable execution) and the
rest are for other kinds of files.<br> <br> </p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Value</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>777</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rwxrwxrwx)</strong> No restrictions on
    permissions. Anybody may do anything.
    Generally not a desirable setting.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>755</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rwxr-xr-x)</strong> The file's owner may
    read, write, and execute the file. All others
    may read and execute the file. This setting
    is common for programs that are used by all
    users.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>700</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rwx------)</strong> The file's owner may
    read, write, and execute the file. Nobody
    else has any rights. This setting is useful
    for programs that only the owner may use and
    must be kept private from others.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>666</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rw-rw-rw-)</strong> All users may read
    and write the file.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>644</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rw-r--r--)</strong> The owner may read
    and write a file, while all others may only
    read the file. A common setting for data
    files that everybody may read, but only the
    owner may change.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>600</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rw-------)</strong> The owner may read
    and write a file. All others have no rights.
    A common setting for data files that the
    owner wants to keep private.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<h2>Directory Permissions</h2>

<p>The <code class="user">chmod</code> command can also be used to control the
access permissions for directories. Again, we can use the octal notation to set
permissions, but the meaning of the r, w, and x attributes is different:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>r</b> - Allows the contents of the directory to be listed
  if the x attribute is also set.</li>
  <li><b>w</b> - Allows files within the directory to be created,
  deleted, or renamed if the x attribute is also set.</li>
  <li><b>x</b> - Allows a directory to be entered (i.e. <code class="user">cd dir</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some useful
settings for directories:<br>
<br>
</p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Value</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Meaning</strong></th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>777</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rwxrwxrwx)</strong> No restrictions on
    permissions. Anybody may list files, create
    new files in the directory and delete files
    in the directory. Generally not a good
    setting.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>755</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rwxr-xr-x)</strong> The directory owner
    has full access. All others may list the
    directory, but cannot create files nor delete
    them. This setting is common for directories
    that you wish to share with other users.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>700</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>(rwx------)</strong> The directory owner
    has full access. Nobody else has any rights.
    This setting is useful for directories that
    only the owner may use and must be kept
    private from others.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<h2>Becoming the Superuser for a Short While</h2>

<p>It is often necessary to become the superuser to
perform important system administration tasks, but
as we know, we
should not stay logged in as the superuser.
In most distributions, there is a program that can give you
temporary access to the superuser's privileges.
This program is called <code class="user">su</code>
(short for substitute user) and can be used in those
cases when you need to be the superuser for a small
number of tasks. To become the superuser, simply
type the <code class="user">su</code> command. You will
be prompted for the superuser's password:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">su</code>
Password:
[root@linuxbox me]#</div>

<p>After executing the <code class="user">su</code> command, we have a new
shell session as the superuser. To exit the superuser session, type <code
class="user">exit</code> and we will return to your previous session.</p>

<p>In most modern distributions, an alternate method is used.  Rather than
using <code class="user">su</code>, these systems employ the <code
class="user">sudo</code> command instead.  With <code class="user">sudo</code>,
one or more users are granted superuser privileges on an as needed basis.  To
execute a command as the superuser, the desired command is simply preceded
with the <code class="user">sudo</code> command.  After the command is entered,
the user is prompted for the their own password rather than the superuser's:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">sudo some_command</code>
Password for me:
[me@linuxbox me]$</div>

<p>In fact, modern distributions don't even set the root account password thus
making it impossible to log in as the root user. A root shell is still possible
with <code class="user">sudo</code> by using the "-i" option: </p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">sudo -i</code>
Password for me:
root@linuxbox:~#</div>

<h2>Changing File Ownership</h2>

<p>We can change the owner of a file by using the <code
class="user">chown</code> command. Here's an example: Suppose we wanted to
change the owner of <code>some_file</code> from "me" to "you". We could:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">sudo chown you some_file</code></div>

<p>Notice that in order to change the owner of a file, we must have superuser
privileges. To do this, our example employed the <code class="user">sudo</code>
command to execute <code class= "user">chown</code>.</p>

<p><code class="user">chown</code> works the same way on directories as it does
on files.</p>

<h2>Changing Group Ownership</h2>

<p>The group ownership of a file or directory may be changed with <code
class="user">chgrp</code>. This command is used like this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">chgrp new_group some_file</code></div>

<p>In the example above, we changed the group ownership of
<code>some_file</code> from its previous group to "new_group". We must be the
owner of the file or directory to perform a <code class=
"user">chgrp</code>.</p>
