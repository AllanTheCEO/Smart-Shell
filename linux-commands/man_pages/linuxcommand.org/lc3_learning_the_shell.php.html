<h1>Why Bother?</h1>

<p>Why do you need to learn the command line anyway? Well, let me tell you a
story. Many years ago we had a problem where I worked. There was a shared drive
on one of our file servers that kept getting full. I won't mention that this
legacy operating system did not support user quotas; that's another story. But
the server kept getting full and it stopped people from working. One of our
software engineers spent a couple of hours writing a C++ program that would
look through all the user's directories and add up the space they were using
and make a listing of the results. Since I was forced to use the legacy OS
while I was on the job, I installed <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">a
  Linux-like command line environment for it.</a> When I heard about the
  problem, I realized I could perform this task with this
  single line:</p>

<pre>
du -s * | sort -nr &gt; $HOME/user_space_report.txt
</pre>

<p>Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are helpful for many tasks, but they are
not good for all tasks. I have long felt that most computers today are not
powered by electricity. They instead seem to be powered by the "pumping" motion
of the mouse. Computers were supposed to free us from manual labor, but how
many times have you performed some task you felt sure the computer should be
able to do but you ended up doing the work yourself by tediously working the
mouse?  Pointing and clicking, pointing and clicking.</p>

<p>I once heard an author say that when you are a child you use a computer by
looking at the pictures. When you grow up, you learn to read and write. Welcome
to Computer Literacy 101. Now let's get to work.</p>
