<h1>Variables</h1>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# sysinfo_page - A script to produce an HTML file

cat &lt;&lt;- _EOF_
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;
        My System Information
        &lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My System Information&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
_EOF_</div>

<p>Now that we have our script working, let's improve it. First off, we'll make
some changes because we want to be lazy. In the script above, we see that the
phrase "My System Information" is repeated. This is wasted typing (and extra
work!) so we'll improve it like this:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# sysinfo_page - A script to produce an HTML file

title="My System Information"

cat &lt;&lt;- _EOF_
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;
        $title
        &lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;$title&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
_EOF_</div>

<p>We added a line to the beginning of the script and replaced the two
occurrences of the phrase "My System Information" with <code>$title</code>.</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>What we have done is to introduce a fundamental concept that appears in
every programming language, <i>variables</i>. Variables are areas of memory
that can be used to store information and are referred to by a name. In the
case of our script, we created a variable called "title" and placed the phrase
"My System Information" into memory. Inside the here script that contains our
HTML, we use "$title" to tell the shell to perform <i>parameter expansion</i>
and replace the name of the variable with the variable's contents.</p>

<p>Whenever the shell sees a word that begins with a "$", it tries to find out
what was assigned to the variable and substitutes it.</p>

<h2>How to Create a Variable</h2>

<p>To create a variable, put a line in the script that contains the name of the
variable followed immediately by an equal sign ("="). No spaces are allowed.
After the equal sign, assign the information to store.</p>

<h2>Where Do Variable Names Come From?</h2>

<p>We just make them up. That's right; we get to choose the names for our
variables. There are a few rules.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Names must start with a letter.</li>
  <li>A name must not contain embedded spaces. Use
  underscores instead.</li>
  <li>Punctuation marks are not permitted.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How Does This Increase Our Laziness?</h2>

<p>The addition of the <code>title</code> variable made our life
easier in two ways. First, it reduced the amount of
typing we had to do. Second and more importantly,
it made our script easier to maintain.</p>

<p>As we write more and more scripts (or do any other kind of programming), we
will see that programs are rarely ever finished. They are modified and improved
by their creators and others.  After all, that's what open source development
is all about. Let's say that we wanted to change the phrase "My System
Information" to "Linuxbox System Information." In the previous version of the
script, we would have had to change this in two locations. In the new version
with the <code>title</code> variable, we only have to change it in one place.
Since our script is so small, this might seem like a trivial matter, but as
scripts get larger and more complicated, it becomes very important.

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<p>When we start our shell session, some variables are already set by the
startup files we looked at earlier. To see all the variables that are in the
environment, use the <code class="user">printenv</code> command. One variable
in our environment contains the host name for the system. We will add this
variable to our script like so:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# sysinfo_page - A script to produce an HTML file

title="System Information for"

cat &lt;&lt;- _EOF_
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;
        $title $HOSTNAME
        &lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;$title $HOSTNAME&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
_EOF_</div>

<p>Now our script will always include the name of the machine on which we are
running. Note that, by convention, environment variables names are
uppercase.</p>
