<h1>A Guided Tour</h1>

<p>It's time to take our tour. The table below lists some interesting places to
explore. This is by no means a complete list, but it should prove to be an
interesting adventure. For each of the directories listed below, do the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="user">cd</code> into each directory.</li>
  <li>Use <code class="user">ls</code> to list the contents of the directory.</li>
  <li>If there is an interesting file, use the <code class="user">file</code> command to determine its contents.</li>
  <li>For text files, use <code class="user">less</code> to view them.</li>
</ul>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <caption>Interesting directories and their contents</caption>

  <tr>
    <th><strong>Directory</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/</code></td>
    <td>The root directory where the file system
    begins. The root directory will probably
    contain only subdirectories.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/boot</code></td>
    <td>This is where the Linux kernel and boot loader
    files are kept. The kernel is a file called <code class="user">vmlinuz</code>.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/etc</code></td>
    <td>The <code class="user">/etc</code> directory
    contains the configuration files for the
    system. All of the files in <code class="user">/etc</code> should be text files. Some points of
    interest are:

    <dl>
      <dt><code class="user">/etc/passwd</code></dt>

      <dd>The <code class="user">passwd</code> file
      contains the essential information for each
      user. This is where user accounts are defined.</dd>

      <dt><code class="user">/etc/fstab</code></dt>

      <dd>The <code class="user">fstab</code> file
      contains a table of devices that get mounted
      when the system boots.  This file defines
      the system's disk drives.</dd>

      <dt><code class="user">/etc/hosts</code></dt>

      <dd>This file lists the network host names
      and IP addresses that are intrinsically known
      to the system.</dd>

      <dt><code class="user">/etc/init.d</code></dt>

      <dd>This directory contains the scripts
      that start various system services 
      at boot time.</dd>
    </dl>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span style="white-space: nowrap"><code class="user">/bin, /usr/bin</code></span></td>
    <td>These two directories contain most of the programs for the 
    system. The <code class="user">/bin</code> directory has the essential
    programs that the system requires to operate,
    while <code class="user">/usr/bin</code> contains
    applications for the system's users.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span style="white-space: nowrap"><code class="user">/sbin, /usr/sbin</code></span></td>
    <td>The <code class="user">sbin</code> directories
    contain programs for system administration, mostly for use by the superuser.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/usr</code></td>
    <td>The <code class="user">/usr</code> directory
    contains a variety of things that support
    user applications. Some highlights:

    <dl>
      <dt><code class="user">/usr/share/X11</code></dt>
      <dd>Support files for the X Window system</dd>

      <dt><code class="user">/usr/share/dict</code></dt>
      <dd>Dictionaries for the spelling checker.  Yes, Linux comes with a
      spelling checker. See <a href= "https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/look1.html"><code class=
      "user">look</code></a> and <a href= "lc3_man_pages/aspell1.html"><code
      class= "user">aspell</code></a>.</dd>

      <dt><code class="user">/usr/share/doc</code></dt>
      <dd>Various documentation files in a
      variety of formats.</dd>

      <dt><code class="user">/usr/share/man</code></dt>
      <dd>The man pages are kept here.</dd>

    </dl>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/usr/local</code></td>
    <td><code class="user">/usr/local</code> and its
    subdirectories are used for the installation
    of software and other files for use on the
    local machine. What this really means is that
    software that is not part of the official
    distribution (which usually goes in <code
    class="user">/usr/bin</code>) goes here.<br><br>

    When you find interesting programs to
    install on your system, they should be
    installed in one of the <code class="user">/usr/local</code> directories. Most
    often, the directory of choice is <code class="user">/usr/local/bin</code>.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/var</code></td>
    <td>The <code class="user">/var</code> directory
    contains files that change as the system is
    running. This includes:

    <dl>
      <dt><code class="user">/var/log</code></dt>
      <dd>Directory that contains log files.  These are updated as the system
      runs. It's a good idea to view the files in this directory from time to
      time, to monitor the health of your system.</dd>

      <dt><code class="user">/var/spool</code></dt>
      <dd>This directory is used to hold files that are queued for some
      process, such as mail messages and print jobs. When a user's mail first
      arrives on the local system (assuming it has local mail, a rare occurrence
      on modern machines that are not mail servers), the messages are first
      stored in <code class= "user">/var/spool/mail</code></dd>
    </dl>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/lib</code></td>
    <td>The shared libraries (similar to DLLs in
    that other operating system) are kept
    here.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/home</code></td>
    <td><code class="user">/home</code> is where users
    keep their personal work. In general, this is
    the only place users are allowed to write
    files. This keeps things nice and clean :-)</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class= "user">/root</code></td>
    <td>This is the superuser's home directory.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/tmp</code></td>
    <td><code class="user">/tmp</code> is a directory
    in which programs can write their temporary files.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/dev</code></td>
    <td>The <code class="user">/dev</code> directory
    is a special directory, since it does not
    really contain files in the usual sense.
    Rather, it contains devices that are available
    to the system. In Linux (like Unix), devices
    are treated like files. You can read and
    write devices as though they were files. For
    example <code class="user">/dev/fd0</code> is the
    first floppy disk drive, <code class=
    "user">/dev/sda</code> is the first hard
    drive. All the devices that the kernel
    understands are represented here.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/proc</code></td>
    <td>The <code class="user">/proc</code> directory
    is also special. This directory does not
    contain files. In fact, this directory does
    not really exist at all. It is entirely
    virtual. The <code class="user">/proc</code>
    directory contains little peep holes into the
    kernel itself. There are a group of numbered
    entries in this directory that correspond to
    all the processes running on the system. In
    addition, there are a number of named entries
    that permit access to the current
    configuration of the system. Many of these
    entries can be viewed. Try viewing <code class=
    "user">/proc/cpuinfo</code>. This entry will
    tell you what the kernel thinks of the system's
    CPU.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user">/media</code></td>
    <td>Finally, we come to <code class="user">/media</code>, a normal directory which is
    used in a special way. The <code class="user">/media</code> directory is used for
    <i>mount points</i>. As we learned in the <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0020.php">second lesson</a>, the
    different physical storage devices (like hard
    disk drives) are attached to the file system
    tree in various places. This process of
    attaching a device to the tree is called
    <i>mounting</i>. For a device to be
    available, it must first be mounted.<br><br>

    When your system boots, it reads a list of mounting instructions in the
    <code class="user">/etc/fstab</code> file, which describes which device is
    mounted at which mount point in the directory tree. This takes care of the
    hard drives, but we may also have devices that are considered temporary,
    such as optical disks and USB storage devices. Since these are removable, they do not
    stay mounted all the time. The <code class="user">/media</code> directory
    is used by the automatic device mounting mechanisms found in modern desktop
    oriented Linux distributions.  To see what devices and mount points are
    used, type <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/mount8.html"> <code
    class="user">mount</code></a>.</td>

<h2>A weird kind of file...</h2>

<p>During your tour, you probably noticed a strange kind of directory entry,
particularly in the <code class="user">/lib</code> directory. When listed with
<code class="user">ls -l</code>, you might have seen something like this:</p>

<pre>lrwxrwxrwx     25 Jul  3 16:42 System.map -&gt; /boot/System.map-4.0.36-3
-rw-r--r-- 105911 Oct 13  2018 System.map-4.0.36-0.7
-rw-r--r-- 105935 Dec 29  2018 System.map-4.0.36-3
-rw-r--r-- 181986 Dec 11  2019 initrd-4.0.36-0.7.img
-rw-r--r-- 182001 Dec 11  2019 initrd-4.0.36.img
lrwxrwxrwx     26 Jul  3 16:42 module-info -&gt; /boot/module-info-4.0.36-3
-rw-r--r--  11773 Oct 13  2018 module-info-4.0.36-0.7
-rw-r--r--  11773 Dec 29  2018 module-info-4.0.36-3
lrwxrwxrwx     16 Dec 11  2019 vmlinuz -&gt; vmlinuz-4.0.36-3
-rw-r--r-- 454325 Oct 13  2018 vmlinuz-4.0.36-0.7
-rw-r--r-- 454434 Dec 29  2018 vmlinuz-4.0.36-3</pre>

<p>Notice the files, <code>System.map,
module-info</code> and <code>vmlinuz</code>. See the
strange notation after the file names?</p>

<p>Files such as this are called <i>symbolic
links</i>. Symbolic links are a special type of
file that points to another file. With symbolic
links, it is possible for a single file to have
multiple names. Here's how it works: Whenever the
system is given a file name that is a symbolic
link, it transparently maps it to the file it is
pointing to.</p>

<p>Just what is this good for? This is a very handy
feature. Let's consider the directory listing above
(which is the <code>/boot</code> directory of an old
system). This system has had multiple
versions of the Linux kernel installed. We can see
this from the files <code>vmlinuz-4.0.36-0.7</code> and
<code>vmlinuz-4.0.36-3</code>. These file names suggest
that both version 4.0.36-0.7 and 4.0.36-3 are
installed. Because the file names contain the
version it is easy to see the differences in the
directory listing. However, this would be confusing
to programs that rely on a fixed name for the
kernel file. These programs might expect the kernel
to simply be called <code>"vmlinuz"</code>. Here is
where the beauty of the symbolic link comes in. By
creating a symbolic link called <code>vmlinuz</code>
that points to <code>vmlinuz-4.0.36-3</code>, we have
solved the problem.</p>

<p>To create symbolic links, we use the <a href=
"lc3_man_pages/ln1.html"><code class="user">ln</code></a>
command.</p>
