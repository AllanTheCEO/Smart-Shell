TR(1)                         User Commands                         TR(1)

NAME
       tr - translate or delete characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]

DESCRIPTION
       Translate,  squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input,
       writing to standard output.

       -c, -C, --complement
              use the complement of SET1

       -d, --delete
              delete characters in SET1, do not translate

       -s, --squeeze-repeats
              replace each sequence  of  a  repeated  character  that  is
              listed  in the last specified SET, with a single occurrence
              of that character

       -t, --truncate-set1
              first truncate SET1 to length of SET2

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SETs are specified as strings of characters.  Most represent them‐
       selves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order

       [CHAR*]
              in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
              REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0

       [:alnum:]
              all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
              all letters

       [:blank:]
              all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
              all control characters

       [:digit:]
              all digits

       [:graph:]
              all printable characters, not including space

       [:lower:]
              all lower case letters

       [:print:]
              all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
              all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
              all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]
              all upper case letters

       [:xdigit:]
              all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
              all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation  occurs  if  -d  is  not  given and both SET1 and SET2
       appear.  -t may be used only when translating.  SET2  is  extended
       to  length  of  SET1 by repeating its last character as necessary.
       Excess  characters  of  SET2  are  ignored.   Only  [:lower:]  and
       [:upper:]  are  guaranteed  to  expand in ascending order; used in
       SET2 while translating, they may only be used in pairs to  specify
       case conversion.  -s uses the last specified SET, and occurs after
       translation or deletion.
