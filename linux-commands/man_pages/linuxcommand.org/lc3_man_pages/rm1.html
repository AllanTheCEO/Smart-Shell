RM(1)                         User Commands                         RM(1)

NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each
       specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If the -I or --interactive=once option is  given,  and  there  are
       more  than  three  files  or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given,
       then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed  with  the  entire
       operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire command
       is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a  terminal,
       and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or --interac‐
       tive=always option is given, rm prompts the user  for  whether  to
       remove  the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is
       skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or  when
              removing  recursively;  less intrusive than -i, while still
              giving protection against most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i);
              without WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when  removing  a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory
              that is on a file system different from that of the  corre‐
              sponding command line argument

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root[=all]
              do not remove '/' (default); with 'all', reject any command
              line argument on a separate device from its parent

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use  the  --recursive
       (-r or -R) option to remove each listed directory, too, along with
       all of its contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo',
       use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to
       recover some of its contents, given  sufficient  expertise  and/or
       time.   For greater assurance that the contents are truly unrecov‐
       erable, consider using shred.
