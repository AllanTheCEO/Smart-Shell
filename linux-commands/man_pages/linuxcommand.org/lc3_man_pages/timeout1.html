TIMEOUT(1)                    User Commands                    TIMEOUT(1)

NAME
       timeout - run a command with a time limit

SYNOPSIS
       timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...
       timeout [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for short
       options too.

       --preserve-status

              exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the

              command times out

       --foreground

              when not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,

              allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and get TTY signals;  in
              this mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out

       -k, --kill-after=DURATION

              also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running

              this long after the initial signal was sent

       -s, --signal=SIGNAL

              specify the signal to be sent on timeout;

              SIGNAL  may be a name like 'HUP' or a number; see 'kill -l'
              for a list of signals

       -v, --verbose
              diagnose to stderr any signal sent upon timeout

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       DURATION is a floating point number with an optional  suffix:  's'
       for  seconds  (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd'
       for days.  A duration of 0 disables the associated timeout.

       If the command times out, and --preserve-status is not  set,  then
       exit with status 124.  Otherwise, exit with the status of COMMAND.
       If no signal is specified, send the TERM signal upon timeout.  The
       TERM  signal  kills  any process that does not block or catch that
       signal.  It may be necessary to use the  KILL  (9)  signal,  since
       this  signal  cannot  be  caught, in which case the exit status is
       128+9 rather than 124.

BUGS
       Some platforms don't currently support timeouts  beyond  the  year
       2038.
