B2SUM(1)                      User Commands                      B2SUM(1)

NAME
       b2sum - compute and check BLAKE2 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       b2sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print or check BLAKE2 (512-bit) checksums.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read BLAKE2 sums from the FILEs and check them

       -l, --length
              digest  length in bits; must not exceed the maximum for the
              blake2 algorithm and must be a multiple of 8

       --tag  create a BSD-style checksum

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

       -z, --zero
              end each output line with NUL,  not  newline,  and  disable
              file name escaping

   The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --ignore-missing
              don't fail or report status for missing files

       --quiet
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       --strict
              exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  sums  are  computed as described in RFC 7693.  When checking,
       the input should be a former output of this program.  The  default
       mode  is to print a line with checksum, a space, a character indi‐
       cating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text or where binary is
       insignificant), and name for each FILE.

       Note:  There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on
       GNU systems.
