<h1>Job Control</h1>

<p>In the previous lesson, we looked at some of the implications of Linux being
a multi-user operating system. In this lesson, we will examine the multitasking
nature of Linux, and how it is controlled with the command line interface.</p>

<p>As with any multitasking operating system, Linux executes multiple,
simultaneous processes. Well, they appear simultaneous, anyway. Actually, a
single processor core can only execute one process at a time but the Linux
kernel manages to give each process its turn at the processor and each appears
to be running at the same time.</p>

<p>There are several commands that are used to control processes. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/ps1.html">ps</a></code> - list the
  processes running on the system</li>

  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/killh.html">kill</a></code> - send a
  signal to one or more processes (usually to
  "kill" a process)</li>

  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/jobsh.html">jobs</a></code> - an
  alternate way of listing your own processes</li>

  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/bgh.html">bg</a></code> - put a process
  in the background</li>

  <li><code class="user"><a href=
  "lc3_man_pages/fgh.html">fg</a></code> - put a process
  in the foreground</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Practical Example</h2>

<p>While it may seem that this subject is rather obscure, it can be very
practical for the average user who mostly works with the graphical user
interface. Though it might not be apparent, most (if not all) graphical
programs can be launched from the command line. Here's an example: there is a
small program supplied with the X Window system called <code
class="user">xload</code> which displays a graph representing system load. We
can execute this program by typing the following:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">xload</code></div>

<p>Notice that the small <code class= "user">xload</code> window appears and
begins to display the system load graph. On systems where <code class=
"user">xload</code> is not available, try <code class= "user">gedit</code>
instead. Notice also that our prompt did not reappear after the program
launched. The shell is waiting for the program to finish before control
returns. If we close the <code class="user">xload</code> window, the <code
class="user">xload</code> program terminates and the prompt returns.</p>

<h2>Putting a Program into the Background</h2>

<p>Now, in order to make life a little easier, we are going to launch the <code
class="user">xload</code> program again, but this time we will put it in the
background so that the prompt will return. To do this, we execute xload like
this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">xload &amp;</code>
[1] 1223
[me@linuxbox me]$</div>

<p>In this case, the prompt returned because the process was put in the
background.</p>

<p>Now imagine that we forgot to use the "&amp;" symbol to put the program into
the background.  There is still hope. We can type <code>Ctrl-z</code> and the
process will be suspended. We can verify this by seeing that the program's
window is frozen. The process still exists, but is idle. To resume the process
in the background, type the <code class="user">bg</code> command (short for
background). Here is an example:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">xload</code>
[2]+ Stopped xload

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">bg</code>
[2]+ xload &amp;</div>

<h2>Listing Running Processes</h2>

<p>Now that we have a process in the background, it would be helpful to display
a list of the processes we have launched. To do this, we can use either the
<code class="user">jobs</code> command or the more powerful <code
class="user">ps</code> command.</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">jobs</code>
[1]+ Running xload&amp;

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ps</code>
PID  TTY   TIME     CMD
1211 pts/4 00:00:00 bash
1246 pts/4 00:00:00 xload
1247 pts/4 00:00:00 ps

[me@linuxbox me]$</div>

<h2>Killing a Process</h2>

<p>Suppose that we have a program that becomes unresponsive; how do we get rid
of it? We use the <code class= "user">kill</code> command, of course. Let's try
this out on <code class="user">xload</code>. First, we need to identify the
process we want to kill. We can use either <code class="user">jobs</code> or
<code class="user">ps</code>, to do this. If we use <code
class="user">jobs</code> we will get back a job number. With <code class=
"user">ps</code>, we are given a <i>process id</i> (PID).  We will do it both
ways:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">xload &amp;</code>
[1] 1292

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">jobs</code>
[1]+ Running xload&amp;

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">kill %1</code>

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">xload &amp;</code>
[2] 1293
[1] Terminated xload

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ps</code>
PID  TTY   TIME     CMD
1280 pts/5 00:00:00 bash
1293 pts/5 00:00:00 xload
1294 pts/5 00:00:00 ps

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">kill 1293</code>
[2]+ Terminated xload

[me@linuxbox me]$</div>

<h2>A Little More About kill</h2>

<p>While the <code class="user">kill</code> command is used to "kill"
processes, its real purpose is to send <i>signals</i> to processes. Most of the
time the signal is intended to tell the process to go away, but there is more
to it than that. Programs (if they are properly written) listen for signals
from the operating system and respond to them, most often to allow some
graceful method of terminating.  For example, a text editor might listen for
any signal that indicates that the user is logging off, or that the computer is
shutting down. When it receives this signal, it could save the work in progress
before it exits. The <code class="user">kill</code> command can send a variety
of signals to processes.  Typing:</p>

<pre>kill -l</pre>

<p>will print a list of the signals it supports.  Many are rather obscure,
but several are handy to know:<br> <br> </p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>Signal&nbsp;#</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>Name</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
    <strong>Description</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>1</strong></td>

    <td><strong>SIGHUP</strong></td>

    <td>
    Hang up signal. Programs can listen for
    this signal and act upon it. This signal is sent
    to processes running in a terminal when you close
    the terminal.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>2</strong></td>

    <td><strong>SIGINT</strong></td>

    <td>
    Interrupt signal. This signal is given
    to processes to interrupt them.
    Programs can process this signal and act upon
    it. We can also issue this signal directly
    by typing <code>Ctrl-c</code> in the terminal window
    where the program is running.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>15</strong></td>

    <td><strong>SIGTERM</strong></td>

    <td>
    Termination signal. This signal is given
    to processes to terminate them. Again,
    programs can process this signal and act upon
    it. This is the default signal sent by the <code class=
    "user">kill</code> command if no signal is
    specified.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>9</strong></td>

    <td><strong>SIGKILL</strong></td>

    <td>
    Kill signal. This signal causes the
    immediate termination of the process by the
    Linux kernel. Programs cannot listen for this
    signal.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now let's suppose that we have a program that
is hopelessly hung and we want
to get rid of it. Here's what we do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <code class="user">ps</code> command to
  get the process id (PID) of the process we want
  to terminate.</li>

  <li>Issue a <code class="user">kill</code> command
  for that PID.</li>

  <li>If the process refuses to terminate (i.e., it
  is ignoring the signal), send increasingly harsh
  signals until it does terminate.</li>
</ol>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ps x | grep bad_program</code>
PID  TTY   STAT TIME COMMAND
2931 pts/5 SN   0:00 bad_program

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">kill -SIGTERM 2931</code>

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">kill -SIGKILL 2931</code></div>

<p>In the example above we used the <code class= "user">ps</code> command with
the x option to list all of our processes (even those not launched from the
current terminal). In addition, we piped the output of the <code
class="user">ps</code> command into <code class="user">grep</code> to list only
list the program we are interested in.  Next, we used <code
class="user">kill</code> to issue a SIGTERM signal to the troublesome program.
In actual practice, it is more common to do it in the following way since the
default signal sent by <code class="user">kill</code> is SIGTERM and <code
class= "user">kill</code> can also use the signal number instead of the signal
name:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">kill 2931</code></div>

<p>Then, if the process does not terminate, force
it with the SIGKILL signal:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">kill -9 2931</code></div>

<h2>That's It!</h2>

<p>This concludes the "Learning the Shell" series of lessons. In the next
series, "Writing Shell Scripts," we will look at how to automate tasks with the
shell.</p>
