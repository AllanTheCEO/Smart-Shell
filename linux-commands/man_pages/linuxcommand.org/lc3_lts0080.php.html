<h1>Expansion</h1>

<p>Each time we type a command line and press the enter key, bash performs
several processes upon the text before it carries out our command. We have seen
a couple of cases of how a simple character sequence, for example “*”, can have
a lot of meaning to the shell. The process that makes this happen is called
<i>expansion</i>. With expansion, we type something and it is expanded into
something else before the shell acts upon it. To demonstrate what we mean by
this, let's take a look at the <code class="user"><a
href="lc3_man_pages/echoh.html">echo</a></code> command.  <code
class="user">echo</code> is a shell builtin that performs a very simple task.
It prints out its text arguments on standard output: </p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo this is a test</code>
this is a test</div>

<p>That's pretty straightforward. Any argument passed to <code class="user">echo</code> gets displayed. Let's try
another example:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo *</code>
Desktop Documents ls-output.txt Music Pictures Public Templates Videos</div>

<p>So what just happened? Why didn't <code class="user">echo</code> print “*”?
As we recall from our work with wildcards, the “*” character means match any
characters in a filename, but what we didn't see in our original discussion was
how the shell does that. The simple answer is that the shell expands the “*”
into something else (in this instance, the names of the files in the current
working directory) before the <code class="user">echo</code> command is
executed. When the enter key is pressed, the shell automatically expands any
qualifying characters on the command line before the command is carried out, so
the <code class="user">echo</code> command never saw the “*”, only its expanded
result. Knowing this, we can see that <code class="user">echo</code> behaved as
expected.  </p> 

<h2>Pathname Expansion</h2>

<p>The mechanism by which wildcards work is called <i>pathname expansion</i>. If we try some
of the techniques that we employed in our earlier lessons, we will see that they are really
expansions. Given a home directory that looks like this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls</code>
Desktop
ls-output.txt
Documents Music
Pictures
Public
Templates
Videos</div>

<p>we could carry out the following expansions:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo D*</code>
Desktop Documents</div>

<p>and:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo *s</code>
Documents Pictures Templates Videos</div>

<p>or even:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo [[:upper:]]*</code>
Desktop Documents Music Pictures Public Templates Videos</div>

<p>and looking beyond our home directory:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo /usr/*/share</code>
/usr/kerberos/share /usr/local/share</div>

<h2>Tilde Expansion</h2>

<p>As we recall from our introduction to the <code class="user">cd</code>
command, the tilde character (“~”) has a special meaning. When used at the
beginning of a word, it expands into the name of the home directory of the
named user, or if no user is named, the home directory of the current user:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo ~</code>
/home/me</div>

<p>If user “foo” has an account, then:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo ~foo</code>
/home/foo</div>


<h2>Arithmetic Expansion</h2>

<p>The shell allows arithmetic to be performed by expansion. This allow us to use the shell
prompt as a calculator:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo $((2 + 2))</code>
4</div>

<p>Arithmetic expansion uses the form:</p>

<pre>$((expression))</pre>

<p>where expression is an arithmetic expression consisting of values and arithmetic
operators.</p>

<p>Arithmetic expansion only supports integers (whole numbers, no decimals), but can
perform quite a number of different operations.</p>

<p>Spaces are not significant in arithmetic expressions and expressions may be nested. For
example, to multiply five squared by three:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo $(($((5**2)) * 3))</code>
75</div>

<p>Single parentheses may be used to group multiple subexpressions. With this technique,
we can rewrite the example above and get the same result using a single expansion
instead of two:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo $(((5**2) * 3))</code>
75</div>

<p>Here is an example using the division and remainder operators. Notice the effect of
integer division:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo Five divided by two equals $((5/2))</code>
Five divided by two equals 2
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo with $((5%2)) left over.</code>
with 1 left over.</div>

<h2>Brace Expansion</h2>

<p>Perhaps the strangest expansion is called <i>brace expansion</i>. With it, we can create
multiple text strings from a pattern containing braces. Here's an example:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo Front-{A,B,C}-Back</code>
Front-A-Back Front-B-Back Front-C-Back</div>

<p>Patterns to be brace expanded may contain a leading portion called a <i>preamble</i> and a
trailing portion called a <i>postscript</i>. The brace expression itself may contain either a
comma-separated list of strings, or a range of integers or single characters. The pattern
may not contain embedded whitespace. Here is an example using a range of integers:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo Number_{1..5}</code>
Number_1 Number_2 Number_3 Number_4 Number_5</div>

<p>A range of letters in reverse order:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo {Z..A}</code>
Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A</div>

<p>Brace expansions may be nested:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo a{A{1,2},B{3,4}}b</code>
aA1b aA2b aB3b aB4b</div>

<p>So what is this good for? The most common application is to make lists of files or
directories to be created. For example, if we were a photographer and had a large
collection of images we wanted to organize into years and months, the first thing we
might do is create a series of directories named in numeric “Year-Month” format. This
way, the directory names will sort in chronological order. we could type out a complete
list of directories, but that's a lot of work and it's error-prone too. Instead, we could do
this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">mkdir Photos</code>
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">cd Photos</code>
[me@linuxbox Photos]$ <code class="cmd">mkdir {2017..2019}-{01..12}</code>
[me@linuxbox Photos]$ <code class="cmd">ls</code>
2017-01 2017-07 2018-01 2018-07 2019-01 2019-07
2017-02 2017-08 2018-02 2018-08 2019-02 2019-08
2017-03 2017-09 2018-03 2018-09 2019-03 2019-09
2017-04 2017-10 2018-04 2018-10 2019-04 2019-10
2017-05 2017-11 2018-05 2018-11 2019-05 2019-11
2017-06 2017-12 2018-06 2018-12 2019-06 2019-12</div>

<p>Pretty slick!</p>

<h2>Parameter Expansion</h2>

<p>We're only going to touch briefly on <i>parameter expansion</i> in this lesson, but we'll be
covering it more later. It's a feature that is more useful in shell scripts than directly
on the command line. Many of its capabilities have to do with the system's ability to
store small chunks of data and to give each chunk a name. Many such chunks, more
properly called <i>variables</i>, are available for our examination. For example, the variable
named “USER” contains our user name. To invoke parameter expansion and reveal the
contents of USER we would do this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo $USER</code>
me</div>

<p>To see a list of available variables, try this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">printenv | less</code></div>

<p>With other types of expansion, if we mistype a pattern, the
expansion will not take place and the echo command will simply display the mistyped
pattern. With parameter expansion, if we misspell the name of a variable, the expansion
will still take place, but will result in an empty string:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo $SUER</code>
[me@linuxbox ~]$</div>

<h2>Command Substitution</h2>

<p><i>Command substitution</i> allows us to use the output of a command as an expansion:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo $(ls)</code>
Desktop Documents ls-output.txt Music Pictures Public Templates Videos</div>

<p>A clever one goes something like this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls -l $(which cp)</code>
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 71516 2007-12-05 08:58 /bin/cp</div>

<p>Here we passed the results of <code class="user">which cp</code> as an
argument to the <code class="user">ls</code> command, thereby getting the
listing of of the <code class="user">cp</code> program without having to know
its full pathname. We are not limited to just simple commands. Entire pipelines
can be used (only partial output shown):</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">file $(ls /usr/bin/* | grep bin/zip)</code>
/usr/bin/bunzip2:
/usr/bin/zip:      ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 
(SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped
/usr/bin/zipcloak: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1
(SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped
/usr/bin/zipgrep:  POSIX shell script text executable
/usr/bin/zipinfo:  ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1
(SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped
/usr/bin/zipnote:  ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1
(SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped
/usr/bin/zipsplit: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1
(SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped</div>

<p>In this example, the results of the pipeline became the argument list of the file
command.
There is an alternate syntax for command substitution in older shell programs which is
also supported in <code class="user">bash</code>. It uses back-quotes instead of the dollar sign and parentheses:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls -l `which cp`</code>
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 71516 2007-12-05 08:58 /bin/cp</div>

<h2>Quoting</h2>

<p>Now that we've seen how many ways the shell can perform expansions, it's time to learn
how we can control it. Take for example:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; test</code>
this is a test</div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo The total is $100.00</code>
The total is 00.00</div>

<p>In the first example, word-splitting by the shell removed extra whitespace
from the echo command's list of arguments. In the second example, parameter
expansion substituted an empty string for the value of “$1” because it was an
undefined variable. The shell provides a mechanism called <i>quoting</i> to
selectively suppress unwanted expansions.</p>

<h2>Double Quotes</h2>

<p>The first type of quoting we will look at is double quotes. If we place text inside double
quotes, all the special characters used by the shell lose their special meaning and are
treated as ordinary characters. The exceptions are “$”, “\” (backslash), and “`” (back-
quote). This means that word-splitting, pathname expansion, tilde expansion, and brace
expansion are suppressed, but parameter expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command
substitution are still carried out. Using double quotes, we can cope with filenames
containing embedded spaces. Imagine we were the unfortunate victim of a file called
<code>two words.txt</code>. If we tried to use this on the command line, word-splitting would
cause this to be treated as two separate arguments rather than the desired single argument:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls -l two words.txt</code>
ls: cannot access two: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access words.txt: No such file or directory</div>

<p>By using double quotes, we can stop the word-splitting and get the desired result; further, we
can even repair the damage:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls -l "two words.txt"</code>
-rw-rw-r-- 1 me me 18 2020-02-20 13:03 two words.txt
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">mv "two words.txt" two_words.txt</code></div>

<p>There! Now we don't have to keep typing those pesky double quotes.
Remember, parameter expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution still
take place within double quotes:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo "$USER $((2+2)) $(cal)"</code>
me 4

                1  2
 3  4  5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29</div>

<p>We should take a moment to look at the effect of double quotes on command substitution.
First let's look a little deeper at how word splitting works. In our earlier example, we saw
how word-splitting appears to remove extra spaces in our text:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo this is a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test</code>
this is a test</div>

<p>By default, word-splitting looks for the presence of spaces, tabs, and newlines (linefeed
characters) and treats them as delimiters between words. This means that unquoted
spaces, tabs, and newlines are not considered to be part of the text. They only serve as
separators. Since they separate the words into different arguments, our example
command line contains a command followed by four distinct arguments. If we add
double quotes:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo "this is a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test"</code>
this is a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test</div>

<p>word-splitting is suppressed and the embedded spaces are not treated as delimiters, rather
they become part of the argument. Once the double quotes are added, our command line
contains a command followed by a single argument.
The fact that newlines are considered delimiters by the word-splitting mechanism causes
an interesting, albeit subtle, effect on command substitution. Consider the following:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo $(cal)</code>
February 2020 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd"> echo "$(cal)"</code>
February 2020
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
                1  2
 3  4  5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29</div>

<p>In the first instance, the unquoted command substitution resulted in a command line
containing thirty-eight arguments. In the second, a command line with one argument that
includes the embedded spaces and newlines.</p>

<h2>Single Quotes</h2>

<p>When we need to suppress all expansions, we use single quotes. Here is a comparison of
unquoted, double quotes, and single quotes:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER</code>
text /home/me/ls-output.txt a b foo 4 me
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo "text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER"</code>
text ~/*.txt {a,b} foo 4 me
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo 'text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER'</code>
text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER</div>

<p>As we can see, with each succeeding level of quoting, more and more of the expansions
are suppressed.</p>

<h2>Escaping Characters</h2>

<p>Sometimes we only want to quote a single character. To do this, we can precede a
character with a backslash, which in this context is called the <i>escape character</i>. Often
this is done inside double quotes to selectively prevent an expansion:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo "The balance for user $USER is: \$5.00"</code>
The balance for user me is: $5.00</div>

<p>It is also common to use escaping to eliminate the special meaning of a character in a
filename. For example, it is possible to use characters in filenames that normally have
special meaning to the shell. These would include “$”, “!”, “&”, “ “, and others. To
include a special character in a filename we can to this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">mv bad\&filename good_filename</code></div>

<p>To allow a backslash character to appear, escape it by typing “\\”. Note that within single
quotes, the backslash loses its special meaning and is treated as an ordinary character.</p>

<h2>More Backslash Tricks</h2>

<p>If we look at the <code class="user">man</code> pages for any program
written by the <a href= "http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a>, we will see that
in addition to command line options consisting of a dash and a single letter,
there are also long option names that begin with two dashes.  For example, the
following are equivalent:</p>

<div class="codeexample">ls -r
ls --reverse</div>

<p>Why do they support both? The short form is for lazy typists on the command
line and the long form is mostly for scripts though some options may only be
available in long form.  Sometimes it is better to use a long option when the
option is obscure or we want to document more clearly what an option is. This
is especially useful when writing scripts where maximum readability is
desired, and besides, anytime we can save ourselves a trip to the man page is a
good thing.

<p>As we might suspect, using the long form options can make a single command
line very long.  To combat this problem, we can use a backslash to get the
shell to ignore a newline character like this:</p>

<div class="codeexample">ls -l \
   --reverse \
   --human-readable \
   --full-time</div>

<p>Using the backslash in this way allows us to embed newlines in our command.
Note that for this trick to work, the newline must be typed immediately after
the backslash. If we put a space after the backslash, the space will be
ignored, not the newline. Backslashes are also used to insert special
characters into our text. These are called <i>backslash escape characters</i>.
Here are the common ones: </p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Escape Character</strong></th>

    <th><strong>Name</strong></th>

    <th><strong>Possible Uses</strong></th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>\n</td>

    <td>newline</td>

    <td>Adding blank lines to text</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>\t</td>

    <td>tab</td>

    <td>Inserting horizontal tabs to text</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>\a</td>

    <td>alert</td>

    <td>Makes our terminal beep</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>\\</td>

    <td>backslash</td>

    <td>Inserts a backslash</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>\f</td>

    <td>formfeed</td>

    <td>Sending this to our printer ejects the page</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>The use of the backslash escape characters is very common. This idea first
appeared in the C programming language. Today, the shell, C++, Perl, python,
awk, tcl, and many other programming languages use this concept. Using the
<code class= "user">echo</code> command with the -e option will allow us to
demonstrate:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo -e "Inserting several blank lines\n\n\n"</code>
Inserting several blank lines

[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo -e "Words\tseparated\tby\thorizontal\ttabs."</code>
Words separated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal&nbsp;&nbsp;tabs
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo -e "\aMy computer went \"beep\"."</code>
My computer went "beep".
[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo -e "DEL C:\\WIN2K\\LEGACY_OS.EXE"</code>
DEL C:\WIN2K\LEGACY_OS.EXE</div>
