<h1>Writing Our First Script and Getting It to Work</h1>

<p>To successfully write a shell script, we have to do three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a script</li>

  <li>Give the shell permission to execute it</li>

  <li>Put it somewhere the shell can find it</li>
</ol>

<h2>Writing a Script</h2>

<p>A shell script is a file that contains ASCII text. To create a shell script,
we use a <i>text editor</i>. A text editor is a program, like a word processor,
that reads and writes ASCII text files.  There are many, many text editors
available for Linux systems, both for the command line  and GUI environments.
Here is a list of some common ones:<br><br></p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Interface</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/vim1.html">vi, vim</a></code>
    </td>

    <td> The granddaddy of Unix text editors, <code class="user">vi</code>, is
    infamous for its obtuse user interface.  On the bright side, <code
    class="user">vi</code> is powerful, lightweight, and fast. Learning <code
    class="user">vi</code> is a Unix rite of passage, since it is universally
    available on Unix-like systems.  On most Linux distributions, an enhanced
    version of <code class="user">vi</code> called <code
    class="user">vim</code> is provided in place of vi. <code
    class="user">vim</code> is a remarkable editor and well worth taking the
    time to learn it.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <code class="user">Emacs</code>
    </td>

    <td> The true giant in the world of text editors is Emacs originally
    written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard
    Stallman</a>. Emacs contains (or can be made to contain) every feature ever
    conceived of for a text editor. It should be noted that <code
    class="user">vi</code> and Emacs fans fight bitter religious wars over
    which is better.</td>

    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/nano1.html">nano</a></code>
    </td>

    <td> <code class="user">nano</code> is a free clone of the text editor
    supplied with the <code class="user">pine</code> email program. <code
    class="user">nano</code> is very easy to use but is very short on features
    compared to <code class= "user">vim</code> and <code class=
    "user">emacs</code>. <code class= "user">nano</code> is recommended for
    first-time users who need a command line editor.</td>

    </td>

    <td> <code class="user">gedit</code> is the editor supplied with the GNOME
    desktop environment. gedit is easy to use and contains enough features to
    be a good beginners-level editor.  </td>

    <td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
    <code class="user">kwrite</code>
    </td>

    <td> <code class="user">kwrite</code> is the "advanced editor" supplied
    with KDE. It has syntax highlighting, a helpful feature for programmers and
    script writers.  </td>

  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>Let's fire up our text editor and type in our first script as follows:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

# My first script

echo "Hello World!"</div>

<p>Clever readers will have figured out how to copy and paste the text into the
text editor ;-)</p>

<p>This is a traditional "Hello World" program. Forms of this program appear in
almost every introductory programming book. We'll save the file with some
descriptive name. How about <code>hello_world</code>?</p>

<p>The first line of the script is important. It is a special construct, called
a <i>shebang</i>, given to the system indicating what program is to be used to
interpret the script. In this case, <code>/bin/bash</code>. Other scripting
languages such as <code>Perl, awk, tcl, Tk,</code> and <code>python</code> also
use this mechanism.</p>

<p>The second line is a <i>comment</i>. Everything that appears after a "#"
symbol is ignored by <code class="user">bash</code>. As our scripts become
bigger and more complicated, comments become vital.  They are used by
programmers to explain what is going on so that others can figure it out. The
last line is the <code class="user"><a href=
"lc3_man_pages/echo1.html">echo</a></code> command. This command simply prints
its arguments on the display.</p>

<h2>Setting Permissions</h2>

<p>The next thing we have to do is give the shell permission to execute our
script. This is done with the <code class="user"><a href=
"lc3_man_pages/chmod1.html">chmod</a></code> command as follows:</p>


<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">chmod 755 hello_world</code></div>

<p>The "755" will give us read, write, and execute permission. Everybody else
will get only read and execute permission. To make the script private, (i.e.,
only we can read and execute), use "700" instead.</p>

<h2>Putting It in Our Path</h2>

<p>At this point, our script will run. Try this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">./hello_world</code></div>

<p>We should see "Hello World!" displayed.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, we need to talk about paths. When we type the
name of a command, the system does not search the entire computer to find where
the program is located. That would take a long time. We see that we don't
usually have to specify a complete path name to the program we want to run, the
shell just seems to know.</p>

<p>Well, that's correct. The shell does know. Here's how: the shell maintains a
list of directories where executable files (programs) are kept, and only
searches the directories on that list. If it does not find the program after
searching each directory on the list, it will issue the famous <code>command
not found</code> error message.</p>

<p>This list of directories is called our <i>path</i>. We can view the list of
directories with the following command:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">echo $PATH</code></div>

<p>This will return a colon separated list of directories that will be searched
if a specific path name is not given when a command is entered.  In our first
attempt to execute our new script, we specified a pathname ("./") to the file.</p>

<p>We can add directories to our path with the following command, where
<i>directory</i> is the name of the directory we want to add:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">export PATH=$PATH:<i>directory</i></code></div>

<p>A better way would be to edit our <code>.bash_profile</code> file to include
the above command. That way, it would be done automatically every time we log
in.</p>

<p>Most Linux distributions encourage a practice in which each user has a
specific directory for the programs they personally use.  This directory is
called <code>bin</code> and is a subdirectory of our home directory. If we do
not already have one, we can create it with the following command:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">mkdir ~/bin</code></div>

<p>If we move or copy our script into our new <code>bin</code> directory we'll
be all set. Now we just have to type:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">hello_world</code></div>

<p>and our script will run. Most distributions will have the <code>~/bin</code>
directory already in the PATH, but on some distributions, most notably Ubuntu
(and other Debian-based distributions), we may need to restart our terminal
session before our newly created <code>bin</code> directory is added to
our PATH.</p>
