<h1>Stay Out of Trouble</h1>

<p>Now that our scripts are getting a little more complicated, Let's look at
some common mistakes that we might run into. To do this, we'll create the
following script called <code>trouble.bash</code>. Be sure to
enter it exactly as written.</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

number=1

<code class="user">if</code> <code class="user">[</code> $number = "1" <code class="user">];</code> <code class="user">then</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "Number equals 1"
<code class="user">else</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "Number does not equal 1"
<code class="user">fi</code></div>

<p>When we run this script, it should output the line "Number equals 1"
because, well, <code>number</code> equals 1. If we don't get the expected
output, we need to check our typing; we've made a mistake.</p>

<h2>Empty Variables</h2>

<p>Let's edit the script to change line 3 from:</p>

<div class="codeexample">number=1</div>

<p>to:</p>

<div class="codeexample">number=</div>

<p>and run the script again. This time we should
get the following:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">./trouble.bash</code>
/trouble.bash: [: =: unary operator expected.
Number does not equal 1</div>

<p>As we can see, <code class="user">bash</code> displayed an error message
when we ran the script.  We might think that by removing the "1" on line 3 it
created a syntax error on line 3, but it didn't. Let's look at the error
message again:</p>

<div class="display">./trouble.bash: [: =: unary operator expected</div>

<p>We can see that <code>./trouble.bash</code> is reporting the
error and the error has to do with "<code class= "user">[</code>". Remember
that "<code class= "user">[</code>" is an abbreviation for the <code
class="user">test</code> shell builtin. From this we can determine that the
error is occurring on line 5 not line 3.</p>

<p>First, to be clear, there is nothing wrong with line 3. <code>number=</code>
is perfectly good syntax. We sometimes want to set a variable's value to
nothing. We can confirm the validity of this by trying it on the command
line:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">number=</code>
[me@linuxbox me]$</div>

<p>See, no error message. So what's wrong with line 5? It worked before.</p>

<p>To understand this error, we have to see what the shell sees. Remember that
the shell spends a lot of its life expanding text. In line 5, the shell expands
the value of <code>number</code> where it sees <code>$number</code>. In our
first try (when <code>number=1</code>), the shell substituted 1 for
<code>$number</code> like so:</p>

<div class="codeexample"><code class="user">if</code> <code class="user">[</code> 1 = "1" <code class="user">];</code> <code class="user">then</code></div>

<p>However, when we set number to nothing (<code>number=</code>), the shell saw
this after the expansion:</p>

<div class="codeexample"><code class="user">if</code> <code class="user">[</code> = "1" <code class="user">];</code> <code class="user">then</code></div>

<p>which is an error. It also explains the rest of the error message we
received. The "<code class= "user">=</code>" is a binary operator; that is, it
expects two items to operate upon - one on each side. What the shell is trying
to tell us is that there is only one item and there should be a unary operator
(like "<code class="user">!</code>") that only operates on a single item.</p>

<p>To fix this problem, change line 5 to read:</p>

<div class="codeexample"><code class="user">if</code> <code class="user">[</code> "$number" = "1" <code class="user">];</code> <code class="user">then</code></div>

<p>Now when the shell performs the expansion it will see:</p>

<div class="codeexample"><code class="user">if</code> <code class="user">[</code> "" = "1" <code class="user">];</code> <code class="user">then</code></div>

<p>which correctly expresses our intent.</p>

<p>This brings up two important things to remember when we are writing scripts.
We need to consider what happens if a variable is set to equal nothing and we
should always put double quotes around parameters that undergo expansion.</p>

<h2>Missing Quotes</h2>

<p>Edit line 6 to remove the trailing quote from the end of the line:</p>

<div class="codeexample">   <code class="user">echo</code> "Number equals 1</div>

<p>and run the script again. We should get
this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">./trouble.bash</code>
./trouble.bash: line 8:
unexpected EOF while looking for matching "
./trouble.bash: line 10 syntax error: unexpected end of file</div>

<p>Here we have another instance of a mistake in one line causing a problem later
in the script. What happened in this case was that the shell kept looking for
the closing quotation mark to determine where the end of the string is, but ran
off the end of the file before it found it.</p>

<p>These errors can be a real pain to track down in a long script. This is one
reason we should test our scripts frequently while we are writing so there is
less new code to test. Also, using a text editor with syntax highlighting makes
these bugs easier to find.</p>

<h2>Isolating Problems</h2>

<p>Finding bugs in scripts can sometimes be very difficult and frustrating.
Here are a couple of techniques that are useful:</p>

<p><b>Isolate blocks of code by "commenting them out."</b> This trick involves
putting comment characters at the beginning of lines of code to stop the shell
from reading them. We can do this to a block of code to see if a particular
problem goes away. By doing this, we can isolate which part of a program is
causing (or not causing) a problem.</p>

<p>For example, when we were looking for our missing quotation we could have
done this:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

number=1

<code class="user">if</code> <code class="user">[</code> $number = "1" <code class="user">];</code> <code class="user">then</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "Number equals 1
#else
#   echo "Number does not equal 1"
<code class="user">fi</code></div>

<p>By commenting out the <code class="user">else</code> clause and running the
script, we could show that the problem was not in the <code class=
"user">else</code> clause even though the error message suggested that it
was.</p>

<p><b>Use echo commands to verify assumptions.</b> As we gain experience
tracking down bugs, we will discover that bugs are often not where we first
expect to find them. A common problem will be that we will make a false
assumption about the performance of our program. A problem will develop at a
certain point in the program and we assume the problem is there. This is
often incorrect. To combat this, we can place <code class= "user">echo</code>
commands in the code while we are debugging, to produce messages that confirm
the program is doing what is expected. There are two kinds of messages that we
can insert.</p>

<p>The first type simply announces that we have reached a certain point in the
program. We saw this in our earlier discussion on stubbing. It is useful to
know that program flow is happening the way we expect.</p>

<p>The second type displays the value of a variable (or variables) used in a
calculation or test. We will often find that a portion of a program will
fail because something that we assumed was correct earlier in the program is,
in fact, incorrect and is causing our program to fail later on.</p>

<h2>Watching Our Script Run</h2>

<p>It is possible to have <code class= "user">bash</code> show us what it is
doing when we run our script. To do this, add a "<code class= "user">-x</code>"
to the first line of the script, like this:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash -x</div>

<p>Now, when we run the script, bash will display each line (with expansions
performed) as it executes it. This technique is called <i>tracing</i>. Here is
what it looks like:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">./trouble.bash</code>
+ number=1
+ '[' 1 = 1 ']'
+ echo 'Number equals 1'
Number equals 1</div>

<p>Alternately, we can use the <code class=
"user">set</code> command within the script to turn
tracing on and off. Use <code class="user">set
-x</code> to turn tracing on and <code class="user">set
+x</code> to turn tracing off. For example.:</p>

<div class="codeexample">#!/bin/bash

number=1

<code class="user">set</code> -x
<code class="user">if</code> <code class="user">[</code> $number = "1" <code
class="user">];</code> <code class="user">then</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "Number equals 1"
<code class="user">else</code>
    <code class="user">echo</code> "Number does not equal 1"
<code class="user">fi</code>
<code class="user">set</code> +x</div>
