<h1>Editing the Scripts We Already Have</h1>

<p>Before we start writing new scripts, We'll take a look at some scripts we
already have. These scripts were put into our home directory when our account
was created, and are used to configure the behavior of our sessions on the
computer. We can edit these scripts to change things.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we will look at a couple of these scripts and learn a few
important new concepts about the shell.</p>

<p>During our shell session, the system is holding a number of facts about the
world in its memory. This information is called the <i>environment</i>. The
environment contains such things as our path, our user name, and much more. We
can examine a complete list of what is in the environment with the <code
class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/seth.html">set</a></code> command.</p>

<p>Two types of commands are often contained in the environment. They are
<i>aliases</i> and <i>shell functions</i>.</p>


<h2>How is the Environment Established?</h2>

<p>When we log on to the system, the bash program starts, and reads a series of
configuration scripts called <i>startup files</i>. These define the default
environment shared by all users. This is followed by more startup files in our
home directory that define our personal environment. The exact sequence depends
on the type of shell session being started. There are two kinds: a <i>login
shell session</i> and a <i>non-login shell session</i>.  A login shell session
is one in which we are prompted for our user name and password; when we start a
virtual console session, for example. A non-login shell session typically
occurs when we launch a terminal session in the GUI.</p>

<p>Login shells read one or more startup files as shown below:</p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <p><strong>File</strong></p>
    </td>

    <td>
    <p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code class="user">/etc/profile</code>  
    </td>
    <td>
      A global configuration script that applies to all users.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code class="user">~/.bash_profile</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      A user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or
         override settings in the global configuration script.
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code class="user">~/.bash_login</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      If <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is not found, bash attempts to
         read this script.    
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code class="user">~/.profile</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      If neither <code>~/.bash_profile</code> nor <code>~/.bash_login</code>
         is found, bash attempts to read this file. This is the
         default in Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu.   
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>Non-login shell sessions read the following startup files:</p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <p><strong>File</strong></p>
    </td>

    <td>
    <p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code class="user">/etc/bash.bashrc</code>  
    </td>
    <td>
      A global configuration script that applies to all users.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code class="user">~/.bashrc</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      A user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or
         override settings in the global configuration script.
      </td>
  </tr>
</table></div>


<p>In addition to reading the startup files above, non-login shells also
inherit the environment from their parent process, usually a login shell.</p>

<p>Take a look at your system and see which of these startup files you have.
Remember— since most of the file names listed above start with a period
(meaning that they are hidden), you will need to use the “-a” option when using
ls.</p>

<p>The <code>~/.bashrc</code> file is probably the most important startup file
from the ordinary user’s point of view, since it is almost always read.
Non-login shells read it by default and most startup files for login shells are
written in such a way as to read the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file as well.</p>

<p>If we take a look inside a typical <code>.bash_profile</code> (this one
taken from a CentOS system), it looks something like this:</p>

<div class="codeexample"># .bash_profile
# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
  . ~/.bashrc
fi

# User specific environment and startup programs
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
export PATH</div>

<p>Lines that begin with a “#” are comments and are not read by the shell.
These are there for human readability. The first interesting thing occurs on
the fourth line, with the following code:</p>

<div class="codeexample">if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
  . ~/.bashrc
fi</div>

<p>This is called an <i>if compound command</i>, which we will cover
fully in a later lesson, but for now we will translate:</p>

<p>If the file "~/.bashrc" exists, then
read the "~/.bashrc" file.</p>

<p>We can see that this bit of code is how a login shell gets the contents of
<code>.bashrc</code>. The next thing in our startup file does is set the PATH
variable to add the <code>~/bin</code> directory to the path.</p>


<p>Lastly, we have:</p>

<div class="codeexample"><code>export PATH</code></div>

<p>The <code class="user"><a
href="lc3_man_pages/exporth.html">export</a></code> command tells the shell to
make the contents of the PATH variable available to child processes of this
shell.</p>

<h2>Aliases</h2>

<p>An alias is an easy way to create a new command which acts as an 
abbreviation for a longer one. It has the following syntax:</p>

<div class="codeexample"><code>alias <i>name</i>=<i>value</i></code></div>

<p>where <i>name</i> is the name of the new command and <i>value</i> 
is the text to be executed whenever <i>name</i> is entered on the 
command line.</p>

<p>Let's create an alias called "l" and make it an abbreviation for 
the command "ls -l". We'll move to our home directory and using 
our favorite text editor, open the file <code>.bashrc</code> and add 
this line to the end of the file:</p>

<div class="codeexample">alias l='ls -l'</div>

<p>By adding the <code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/aliash.html"
>alias</a></code> command to the file, we have created a new command called "l"
which will perform "ls -l". To try out our new command, close the terminal
session and start a new one. This will reload the <code>.bashrc</code> file.
Using this technique, we can create any number of custom commands for
ourselves. Here is another one to try:</p>

<div class="codeexample">alias today='date +"%A, %B %-d, %Y"'</div>

<p>This alias creates a new command called "today" that will display 
today's date with nice formatting.</p>

<p>By the way, the <code class="user">alias</code> command is just 
another shell builtin. We can create our aliases directly at the 
command prompt; however they will only remain in effect during the 
current shell session. For example:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">alias l='ls -l'</code>
</div>

<h2>Shell Functions</h2>

<p>Aliases are good for very simple commands, but to create something more
complex, we need <i>shell functions</i>. Shell functions can be thought of as
"scripts within scripts" or little sub-scripts. Let's try one. Open
<code>.bashrc</code> with our text editor again and replace the alias for
"today" with the following:</p>

<div class="codeexample">today() {
    echo -n "Today's date is: "
    date +"%A, %B %-d, %Y"
}</div>

<p>Believe it or not, <code class= "user"><a
href="lc3_man_pages/functionh.html">()</a></code> is a shell builtin too, and
as with <code class="user">alias</code>, we can enter shell functions directly
at the command prompt.</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">today() {</code>
&gt; <code class="cmd">echo -n "Today's date is: "</code>
&gt; <code class="cmd">date +"%A, %B %-d, %Y"</code>
&gt; <code class="cmd">}</code>
[me@linuxbox me]$</div>

<p>However, like <code class="user">alias</code>, shell functions defined
directly on the command line only last as long as the current shell
session.</p>
