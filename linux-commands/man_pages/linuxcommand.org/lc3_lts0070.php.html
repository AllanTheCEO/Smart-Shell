<h1>I/O Redirection</h1>

<p>In this lesson, we will explore a powerful feature used by command line
programs called <i>input/output redirection</i>. As we have seen, many commands
such as <code class="user">ls</code> print their output on the display. This
does not have to be the case, however. By using some special notations we can
<i>redirect</i> the output of many commands to files, devices, and even to the
input of other commands.</p>

<h2>Standard Output</h2>

<p>Most command line programs that display their results do so by sending their
results to a facility called <i>standard output</i>. By default, standard
output directs its contents to the display. To redirect standard output to a
file, the "&gt;" character is used like this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls &gt; file_list.txt</code></div>

<p>In this example, the <code class="user">ls</code> command is executed and
the results are written in a file named <code>file_list.txt</code>. Since the
output of <code class="user">ls</code> was redirected to the file, no results
appear on the display.</p>

<p>Each time the command above is repeated, <code>file_list.txt</code> is
overwritten from the beginning with the output of the command <code class=
"user">ls</code>. To have the new results <i>appended</i> to the file instead,
we use "&gt;&gt;" like this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$<code class="cmd">ls &gt;&gt; file_list.txt</code></div>

<p>When the results are appended, the new results are added to the end of the
file, thus making the file longer each time the command is repeated. If the
file does not exist when we attempt to append the redirected output, the file
will be created.</p>

<h2>Standard Input</h2>

<p>Many commands can accept input from a facility called <i>standard input</i>.
By default, standard input gets its contents from the keyboard, but like
standard output, it can be redirected. To redirect standard input from a file
instead of the keyboard, the "&lt;" character is used like this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">sort &lt; file_list.txt</code></div>

<p>In the example above, we used the <code class= "user"><a
href="lc3_man_pages/sort1.html">sort</a></code> command to process the contents
of <code>file_list.txt</code>.  The results are output on the display since the
standard output was not redirected.  We could redirect standard output to
another file like this:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">sort &lt; file_list.txt &gt; sorted_file_list.txt</code></div>

<p>As we can see, a command can have both its input and output redirected. Be
aware that the order of the redirection does not matter. The only requirement
is that the redirection operators (the "&lt;" and "&gt;") must appear after the
other options and arguments in the command.</p>

<h2>Pipelines</h2>

<p>The most useful and powerful thing we can do with I/O redirection is to
connect multiple commands together to form what are called <i>pipelines</i>.
With pipelines, the standard output of one command is fed into the standard
input of another. Here is a very useful example:</p>

<div class="display">[me@linuxbox me]$ <code class="cmd">ls -l | less</code></div>

<p>In this example, the output of the <code class= "user">ls</code> command is
fed into <code class= "user">less</code>. By using this <code class="user">"|
less"</code> trick, we can make any command have scrolling output.</p>

<p>By connecting commands together, we can accomplish amazing feats. Here are
some examples to try:<br> <br> </p>

<div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>
  <caption>Examples of commands used together with pipelines</caption>

  <tr>
    <th><strong>Command</strong></th>
    <th><strong>What it does</strong></th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span style="white-space: nowrap"><code class="user">ls -lt | <a href="lc3_man_pages/head1.html">head</a></code></span></td>

    <td>Displays the 10 newest files in the current directory.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span style="white-space: nowrap"><code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/du1.html">du</a> | sort -nr</code></span></td>

    <td> Displays a list of directories and how
    much space they consume, sorted from the
    largest to the smallest.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span style="white-space: nowrap"><code class="user"><a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/find1.html">find</a> . -type f -print | <a href="lc3_man_pages/wc1.html">wc</a> -l</code></span></td>

    <td>Displays the total number of files in the
    current working directory and all of its
    subdirectories.</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<h2>Filters</h2>

<p>One kind of program frequently used in pipelines is called a <i>filter</i>.
Filters take standard input and perform an operation upon it and send the
results to standard output. In this way, they can be combined to process
information in powerful ways. Here are some of the common programs that can act
as filters:<br><br></p>

  <caption>

  <tr>
    <th><strong>Program</strong></th>
    <th><strong>What it does</strong></th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/sort1.html">sort</a></code></td>

    <td>Sorts standard input then outputs the
    sorted result on standard output.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/uniq1.html">uniq</a></code></td>

    <td>Given a sorted stream of data from
    standard input, it removes duplicate lines of
    data (i.e., it makes sure that every line is
    unique).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/grep1.html">grep</a></code></td>

    <td>Examines each line of data it receives
    from standard input and outputs every line
    that contains a specified pattern of
    characters.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="user"><a href="lc3_man_pages/fmt1.html">fmt</a></code></td>

    <td>Reads text from standard input, then

<h2>Performing tasks with pipelines</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Printing from the command line.</strong> Linux
    provides a program called <code class="user"><a
    href="lc3_man_pages/lpr1.html">lpr</a></code> that
    accepts standard input and sends it to the
    printer. It is often used with pipes and
    filters. Here are a couple of examples:</p>

<pre>cat poorly_formatted_report.txt | fmt | pr | lpr

cat unsorted_list_with_dupes.txt | sort | uniq | pr | lpr</pre>

    <p>In the first example, we use <code class=
    "user">cat</code> to read the file and output it
    to standard output, which is piped into the
    standard input of <code class="user">fmt.
    fmt</code> formats the text into neat paragraphs
    and outputs it to standard output, which is
    piped into the standard input of <code class=
    "user">pr. pr</code> splits the text neatly into
    pages and outputs it to standard output, which
    is piped into the standard input of <code class=
    "user">lpr. lpr</code> takes its standard input
    and sends it to the printer.</p>

    <p>The second example starts with an unsorted
    list of data with duplicate entries. First, <code
    class="user">cat</code> sends the list into <code
    class="user">sort</code> which sorts it and feeds
    it into <code class="user">uniq</code> which
    removes any duplicates. Next <code class=
    "user">pr</code> and <code class="user">lpr</code>
    are used to paginate and print the list.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Viewing the contents of tar files</strong>
    Often you will see software distributed as a
    <i>gzipped tar file</i>. This is a traditional
    Unix style tape archive file (created with <code
    class="user"><a href=
    "lc3_man_pages/tar1.html">tar</a></code>) that has
    been compressed with <code class="user"><a href=
    "lc3_man_pages/gzip1.html">gzip</a></code>. You can
    recognize these files by their traditional file
    extensions, ".tar.gz" or ".tgz". You can use the
    following command to view the directory of such
    a file on a Linux system:</p>

<pre>tar tzvf name_of_file.tar.gz | less</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
